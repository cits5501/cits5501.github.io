<h2 id="project-version-control">1. Project version control</h2>
<p>The week 5 lectures include a workshop on using Git and GitHub for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version
control</a>.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you have used Git and GitHub, you should
work through the resources included there, including the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world">Github
Hello World Step by Step</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>If you <em>have</em> used Git and GitHub before, you might like to
think in more depth about how version control can contribute to (or pose
problems for) software quality. The questions below ask you to reflect
on this.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Question</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>What is the basic purpose of version control? How does it differ from
simply keeping copies of files with different names or dates?</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Question</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>How might version control make software development easier or harder?
You may want to check online resources to help you answer these
questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can version control make it easier to trace the source of a
bug?</li>
<li>In what ways might poor version control practices (e.g. unclear
commit messages, cluttered history) make testing or debugging
harder?</li>
<li>How might including large generated files in a repository affect
development speed and reliability?<br />
 </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Question</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>In group assessments from previous units, has your group adopted any
conventions or best practices when using version control? If so, do you
think they were useful – and in what ways? If not, did you encounter any
problems where adopting a convention might have made things easier?</p>
<p>Think about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why might a team agree on a commit message convention or branching
strategy?</li>
<li>What problems can arise if different team members ignore these
agreements?</li>
<li>How could poor version control practices create extra work for
testers or integrators?<br />
 </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Question</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Can you think of any indicators in a version control repository that
might be a sign of good version control discipline (or conversely, or
poor version control discipline)? If you were reviewing a peer’s
repository, what would you look for as signs of good or bad version
control discipline?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Version control tools can either support software quality or
undermine it, depending on how they’re used. Good practices make
repositories easier to work with, simplify testing, and reduce the risk
of errors. But poor practices can lead to confusion, wasted time, and
hidden bugs.</p>
<p>In a well-managed repository, the version control history should
clearly show</p>
<ul>
<li><em>what</em> changed</li>
<li><em>when</em> it changed</li>
<li>and <em>why</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information about the first two items comes directly from the version
control tool – all version control tools will show what content in what
files was changed, and when a commit occurred. However, providing
reasons <em>why</em> the change was made can only be done by the
developer who committed it. In version control systems, <em>commit
messages</em> are used to explain the reasons for a change. You can read
more about what makes for good or bad commit messages in Simon Tatham’s
guide to <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/commit-messages/">“Writing
commit messages”</a>.</p>
<p>When used properly, version control systems make it much easier to
solve problems like</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosing when and how a bug was introduced.</li>
<li>Understanding the reasons for implementation decisions.</li>
<li>Reverting buggy software to a known good state.</li>
<li>Letting teams work on multiple features in parallel (using branches
and merges).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="version-control-best-practices">Version control best
practices</h4>
<p>We won’t discuss version control best practices in exhaustive detail
here, but will highlight a few important ones. For more detail, you can
read Michael Ernst’s <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html">“Version
control concepts and best practices”</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Avoid committing generated files.</em> They add “noise” to the
version control history, are a common source of merge conflicts, and can
quickly bloat the repository.
<!-- see also https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-dont-commit-generated-files-to-master --></li>
<li><em>Avoid versioning binary files where possible.</em> Instead,
version the text format or build recipe. If you do need to track binary
files, consider specialised tools (e.g. Git LFS).</li>
<li><em>Write informative commit messages.</em> A good message explains
<em>what</em> changed and <em>why</em>. If your team follows a standard
(e.g. <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional
Commits</a>), stick to it.</li>
<li><em>Commit early, commit often</em>. Don’t leave work uncommitted
for any extended period of time – you lose the advantage of having a
version control system if you do that.</li>
<li><em>Create commits at logical points.</em> Each commit should
represent a coherent change, small enough to review and test in
isolation. <!--
- *Use branches for features and fixes.** This keeps experimental work separate from production-ready code and makes integration safer.
--></li>
<li><em>Review before merging.</em> Code review not only catches bugs,
it also enforces quality in commit history and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might notice that some of these practices are in tension – if you
<em>commit early and commit often</em> to stop work from being lost, how
can you also ensure that you’ve provided good commit messages, or
created commits at logical points?</p>
<p>The answer to this apparent paradox is that it’s possible to
<em>rewrite the local history</em> of your repository, and in fact it’s
a good idea to</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tidy history before sharing.</em> Squash or reorganise commits
so that the branch history tells a clear story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve pushed your commits to a remote repository, it’s
generally a bad idea to alter them, since other team-mates’ work may be
affected by any changes. But <em>before</em> you push your commits, it’s
perfectly alright – in fact, recommended – to tidy up the history before
pushing it. Read Carlos Schults’s post <a href="https://carlosschults.net/en/git-beautiful-history/">“Make Your
Git History Look Beautiful Using Amend and Rebase”</a> for more
information on how to do this.</p>

for another semester - some exercises

1. **Commit Messages and History**

   * Create a small repository and add a simple program (e.g. “Hello world”).
   * Make three changes to it, but commit with vague messages like “fix”, “update”, or “stuff”.
   * Now try to identify *why* you made each change.
   * Redo the exercise with clear, descriptive messages. Compare the difference in traceability.

2. **Generated and Binary Files**

   * Add a large generated file (e.g. a compiled binary, log file, or data export) to the repository and commit it.
   * Observe how the repo size changes. Then make a trivial edit and commit again—note that the *entire file* is stored again.
   * Remove the file from version control, add it to `.gitignore`, and discuss why this is a better approach.

3. **Commit Granularity**

   * Make multiple unrelated changes in your code (e.g. fix a bug, add a feature, update documentation). Commit them *all together*.
   * Now imagine trying to undo just the bug fix—how easy is it?
   * Redo the exercise, this time committing each change separately. Compare the flexibility.

4. **Branching and Integration**

   * Create a new branch for a “feature” and make a couple of commits.
   * Switch back to main, make a conflicting change, then try merging the feature branch.
   * Resolve the conflict, then tidy the history (e.g. squash commits).
   * Reflect on how branching helps isolate work, and how merge practices affect repository clarity.

5. **Code Review Simulation (Optional, Pair Activity)**

   * Swap repositories with a partner. Review their commit history for clarity, granularity, and adherence to best practices.
   * Give each other feedback: what would make the history easier to understand or maintain?

<div class="block-caption">
<p>Pre-reading</p>
</div>
<p>The following exercises in this worksheet assume general familiarity
with logic-based testing concepts, so if you haven’t already, it’s
recommended you work through chapter 8 from the Ammann and Offutt
textbook before attempting them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="logic-notation">2. Logic notation</h2>
<p>The remaining sections of this lab focus on assessing whether a test
suite thoroughly exercises (i.e., has good coverage of) the logic
expressions contained in the component under test.</p>
<p>When writing logic expressions, we will often use mathematical
notation for “and”, “or”, and “not”:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> – “and”</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> – “or”</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\neg\)</span> – “not”</li>
</ul>
<p>This notation is independent of any language; it could be turned into
Java, or C, or Python – each of which uses different logical operators –
depending on what language our system and our tests are implemented
in.</p>
<p>If writing actual Java code, however, we use the normal Java logical
operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code> – “and”</li>
<li><code>||</code> – “or”</li>
<li><code>!</code> – “not”</li>
</ul>
<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">
<div class="block-caption">
<p>Other operators and languages</p>
</div>
<p>Java also has non–short-circuiting logic operators, <code>|</code>
and <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>We won’t be focusing on Python in this unit – but for reference, in
Python, the logic operators are all spelled out as English words: “and”,
“or” and “not”.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="terminology-clauses-and-predicates">3. Terminology – clauses and
predicates</h2>
<p>If you need to, review the lecture material and recommended readings
that explain what <em>predicates</em> and <em>clauses</em> are.</p>
<p>What are the <em>clauses</em> in the predicates below?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(((f \leqslant g) \wedge (x &gt; 0))
\vee (M \wedge (e &lt; d +c))\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(G \vee ((m &gt; a) \vee (s \leqslant
o + n)) \wedge U\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="making-clauses-active">4. Making clauses active</h2>
<p>To make a particular clause <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in
some predicate <em>active</em> means to assign values to variables so
that the truth-value of the whole predicate depends on <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>When coming up with test values which make clauses active, the
easiest way of showing your test values is in a table.</p>
<p>E.g. Suppose we have a predicate <span class="math inline">\(s \wedge
(m \vee w)\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> = “the moon is full”</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> = “the sky is clear”</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> = “the wind is calm”</li>
</ul>
<p>If asked to come up with test inputs which make each clause active in
turn, and achieve Restricted Active Clause Coverage, we could show them
like this:</p>
<table style="width:99%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 29%" />
<col style="width: 40%" />
<col style="width: 28%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Test description</strong></th>
<th><strong>Inputs</strong></th>
<th><strong>Predicate value</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Make s active, and<br>   s = true<br>   s = false</td>
<td>s = true, m = true, w = false<br> s = false, m = true, w =
false</td>
<td>true<br> false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Make m active, and<br>   m = true<br>   m = false</td>
<td>s = true, m = true, w = false<br> s = true, m = false, w =
false</td>
<td>true<br> false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Make w active, and<br>   w = true<br>   w = false</td>
<td>s = true, m = false, w = true<br> s = true, m = false, w =
false</td>
<td>true<br> false</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Here, we aren’t told what the expected outcome is if the predicate
comes out true or false; if we were, we could add a column “Expected
outcome” which listed this.)</p>
<p>If you aren’t told the exact <em>types</em> of variables or methods
used in a predicate, that means you should be able to work them out from
context. For example, for the predicate</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(x &gt; 0) \vee (M \wedge (e &lt; d +c))
\]</span></p>
<p>you can assume that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a
boolean, and that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are some numeric type (such
as <code>int</code>).</p>
<p>For each of the clauses in the predicates below, identify test inputs
which will make the clause <em>active</em> (that is: state what values
need to be assigned to the variables in the predicate), and vary that
clause so it takes on both true and false values. (In other words: write
test values that achieve Restricted Active Clause Coverage.) Explain
your reasoning.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \vee (B \wedge \neg C)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x &gt; 0 \; \vee  (M \wedge (e &lt; d
+c))\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(G \vee (m \geqslant a) \vee H \wedge
U\)</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scenario-trap-doors">5. Scenario – trap-doors</h2>
<p>Suppose a component under test has the following requirements:</p>
<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">
<p>If the lever is pulled and the chair is occupied, open the
trap-door.</p>
<p>If the button is pressed, open the trap-door.</p>
</div>
<p>Represent the component as a set of logic expressions. You should
explain what each variable in your expressions means. (For an example,
look in section 2 at the way we gave definitions for the variables in
the predicate <span class="math inline">\(s \wedge (m \vee
w)\)</span>.)</p>
<p>(Hint: if you’re stuck, try writing out what the component does as
one or more “<code>if</code>” statements, in pseudocode. Then recall
that the set of all predicates in a system means the set of all logical
expressions found in things like “<code>if</code>” statements.)</p>
<h2 id="scenario-login-page">6. Scenario – login page</h2>
<p>Suppose you are part of a team developing a website called
“RateMyVeterinarian”, where people can log in and provide anonymous
reviews of the veterinarian services they use.</p>
<p>Requirements for the site are currently being finalised, and one
requirement is stated as follows:</p>
<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">
<p>When a user enters a user ID and password into the login page and
hits the “log in” button, then if that user ID is listed in the “users”
database, and the password matches against the password in the record
for that user, and the user record does not state that the account has
been disabled, a “Welcome” page should be displayed.</p>
</div>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>How easy to understand do you think this requirement is? If you
think it could be made easier to understand, suggest how.</p></li>
<li><p>One of your colleagues suggests that because correctly
authenticating users (and keeping their details secure) is an important
feature, this requirement should be thoroughly tested – so you should
design a test suite that meets RAC (Restricted Active Clause) levels of
coverage. Do you agree? Why or why not?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">7. Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>When solving problems that involve logic-based testing, make sure you
understand the difference between <em>expressions</em> and
<em>statements</em> in the programming language or languages that you’re
using.</p>
<p>For instance, simple Java <code>if</code> statements <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.9">are
of the form</a>:</p>
<p>   <code>if (</code> <strong><code>Boolean expression</code></strong>
<code>) {</code> <strong><code>Statements</code></strong>
<code>}</code></p>
<p>Statements are parts of the language that <em>do</em> things; we
usually execute them in order to achieve some side effect. Boolean
expressions evaluate to a Java <code>boolean</code> value, and we
typically intend that they should <em>not</em> have side effects – they
just evaluate to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>When we do logic-based testing, we’re focusing on the collection of
logic <em>expressions</em> of a program or system that control program
flow, and working out how to write tests that thoroughly exercise the
component parts (the clauses) of those expressions.</p>
<!--
 (unless they happen to have more logic expressions within them); we're just
working out how to get the correct clauses to be evaluated. If using the "Arrange, Act, Assert"
pattern, we're focusing on the "Act" portion -- what parameters etc. we need to supply in
order for the correct clauses to be evaluated.
-->
<p>Confusing expressions with statements, or vice versa, is a common
reason for students to do poorly in test or exam questions involving
logic-based testing.</p>
