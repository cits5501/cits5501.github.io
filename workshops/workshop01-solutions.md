Laptop requirement

:::

When attending lab classes, you will need access to a laptop.

UWA provides [financial support][fin-supp] via the "SOS IT Equipment Scheme" to students who
are unable to purchase a laptop due to financial hardship.

</div>



## 1. Accessing required software

We will be using the Java language for the bulk of the labs,
so you will need access to a platform where
the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed, and where you can make
use of a good Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or editor.

There are several options available:

- You can install Microsoft Visual Studio Code on your laptop or other personal computer
  (it is available for all common operating systems, such as Windows, Linux and Mac
  OS)
- You can access a Visual Studio Code–like environment on the web, using the
  [GitPod][gitpod] cloud-based service
- You are also welcome to install any other editor or IDE of your choice (although
  our lab facilitators won't be able to assist you in troubleshooting it, should you
  encounter problems).

[gitpod]: https://www.gitpod.io

We describe these options in the following sections.

**Microsoft Visual Studio Code**

:   One recommended editor is [Microsoft Visual Studio Code][vs-code] ("VS
    Code", for short) --
    it is available on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac
    OS), so you should be able to install it on a laptop or home PC.

    [vs-code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

    Some guidelines on configuring VS Code
    for Java development can be found [on the VS Code website][vs-code-java].

    [vs-code-java]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial

    If using VS Code, you will need to make sure that

    - you have the JDK installed (see the [Oracle website][jdk] for
      downloads)
    - you've installed the [Extension Pack for Java][java-ext] within VS Code.
      Click the "extensions" icon in the left sidebar of VS Code (looks like
      this: ![](VSCode-Extension-Icon.png){ width="0.7cm" }), search for "Extension Pack for
      Java" in the search bar at top, and click "install".

    [jdk]: https://www.oracle.com/au/java/technologies/downloads/
    [java-ext]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
    [bluej]: https://www.bluej.org

    Download the `lab-01-code.zip` file from
    <https://cits5501.github.io/resources/#lab-labs>, and unzip it
    somewhere on your computer. Then run VS Code, select "File" / "Open
    Folder", and open the folder containing the lab 1 code. (You can
    "agree to trust" the authors of the code, if a message about that
    pops up.)

    Then open one of the `.java` files in the `src` subdirectory,
    and go to ["Common steps in VS Code or GitPod"](#common-steps).

**GitHub CodeSpaces**

:   It's possible to access a VS Code–like environment on the web, without
    needing to install any software, via [GitHub Codespaces][codespaces].
    Codespaces provides web-based access to development environments
    hosted in the cloud, and provides a quota of free hours each month (which most students
    will probably not exceed).

    To use CodeSpaces, you'll need to have a GitHub account, so if you don't have
    one already, visit <https://github.com/> and create one. Once that's done, ensure you're
    logged in to GitHub.

    Once you're logged in, you can visit any GitHub-hosted repository and will be able
    to open the code using CodeSpaces. The repository could be owned by someone else,
    or could be one you've created yourself. For this lab, visit    
    <https://github.com/cits5501/lab01>. Click the green "Code" button to get a drop-down menu with tabs; select the
    "codespaces" tab, then "Create codespace on master".

    GitHub Codespaces will start a cloud-based virtual machine in which
    [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] (VS Code) is running. We don't provide detailed
    instructions on how to use CodeSpaces with Java project – you can find those
    [here][codespaces-java] – but in general, you'll want to

    - install the "Extension Pack for Java" (a prompt should appear, lower right, after you
      open the project)
    - accept offers to "import Java projects" (lower left of the screen, under "Java
      Projects"
    - click the "flask" icon, enable Java tests, and specifically enable "Jupyter" tests. 

    [codespaces-java]: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/setting-up-your-java-project-for-codespaces

    <div style="border: solid 2pt orange; border-radius: 5pt; background-color: hsl(22.35, 100%, 85%, 1); padding: 1em;">

    Note that if you use GitPod, your work is stored on a temporary, cloud-based virtual
    machine (VM), and will disappear once the VM is no longer in use. If you want to
    store your work more permanently, it's up to you transfer it to some other storage
    location, such as student network storage (see [here][storage] for links to more
    information on student network storage).

[**Common steps in VS Code or GitPod**]{ #common-steps }

:   Once either VS Code or GitPod is set up as an editor, we can run
    some (already written) unit tests.

    When the editors open,
    you should see a message about "Java projects being opened". Wait for
    that to pass, and there'll now be a "Testing" icon on the left sidebar,
    in the shape
    of a conical lab flask (like this: ![](vs-code-testing-icon.png){ width="0.7cm" }).

    Click on the testing icon, and then on the button "Enable Java Tests".
    Select "JUnit Jupyter" tests from the options that pop up, and you
    should see a message saying that "Test libraries have been downloaded
    into 'lib/'".

    If you open the `CalculatorSimpleTest.java` file, then after a short
    while, a small icon should appear to the left of the line
    "`public class CalculatorSimpleTest`". (Depending on your version of VS Code
    and the state of the tests, it may show up as a green triangle, a red cross,
    or a green tick.) Clicking it will run all `@Test`
    methods in the class.

    (If the icon doesn't appear: select "View" / "Problems" from the menu,
    and see if there have been any compilation problems. If there have:
    select "Java Projects" from the left sidebar, "Reference Libraries",
    and then the "+" (add) button. Add the
    `lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.9.2.jar` file that should be in
    the `lib` directory, then hit the "refresh" icon under "Referenced
    Libraries". Ideally, the "Problems" should now disappear and the green
    triangle icon appear. If it doesn't: click somewhere in the
    `CalculatorSimpleTest.java` source code, hit the `ctrl-shift-P` key
    combination, and type "java: run tests".)

    If you are able to run the tests, you should see some tests pass (for instance, `testAdd`),
    but most tests fail. This is expected!


**Other IDEs**

You may already have some other IDE or editor you prefer to work in besides VS Code. If that
is the case, you are welcome to use it for your CITS5501 work. Some other freely available IDEs are:

- Netbeans, downloadable from <https://netbeans.org>
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, downloadable from
  <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers>
- IntelliJ IDEA Community, downloadable from
  <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>

As a first step for today's lab, ensure you have access to your preferred IDE or editor.

After downloading and opening the lab code from
<https://cits5501.github.io/resources/#lab-labs>,
you may need to instruct your IDE to add the "JUnit 5" libraries to the project; typically,
viewing the project *properties* in your IDE will reveal some way of doing this.


## 2. JUnit tests

### Download and compile lab code

Take a look at the `Calculator` class, in `Calculator.java` --
this class has trivial functionality, but is useful as an
example of a *class under test*.

Take a look at the `CalculatorSimpleTest` class, in
`CalculatorSimpleTest.java`. This class defines a number of
*JUnit tests* for our `Calculator` class.

Test classes can be called anything, but by convention,
*unit tests* (which are written to test a single class)
usually start with the same name as the *class under test*,
followed by a description of the test (or just the word "Test").

### Run the JUnit tests

Run the tests in the `CalculatorSimpleTest` class.

In many IDEs, this can be done by right-clicking on the class (after compiling)
and selecting "Test All". In VS Code, it can be done by clicking the
green triangle icon in the left margin of the code (see previous
section).

You should see that some tests "pass" (with green ticks) and
some "fail" (with red crosses) -- see if you can work out
what the failing `testSubstract` test is telling you about what the problem is.

### Inspect the JUnit tests

Look at the parts of the `CalculatorSimpleTest` test class,
using the JUnit User Guide (<https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/>)
as a reference.

- Test classes can be called anything.
- Test cases are written in methods annotated `@Test`
- For each test, the methods annotated `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`
  are run before the test and after the test, respectively.\
  These methods can be used to create and destroy test *fixtures* --
  in Java, fixtures are normally a set of objects in a known state.
  (The state *can* include things outside the Java program, however --
  databases, files on a remote system, anything we like. But for unit tests,
  the fixtures will only be Java objects.)
- The `testSubtractThrowsException()` test is intended to discover whether
  the `Calculator.subtract()` method throws an *exception* in
  circumstances where it should.

  The code

  ```{ .java startFrom="47"}
      Throwable exception = assertThrows(
          ArithmeticException.class,
          () -> c.subtract()
      );
  ```

  calls the `assertThrows` method, which is used to assert that when its
  second parameter (a bit of executable
  Java code, called a *lambda expression*) is run, it throws
  the exception specified by its first parameter.

  We will look at these more later.
- Note that the first few test methods take no arguments,
  but the test `\texttt{addZeroHasNoEffect}`{=latex}
  is what JUnit calls a parameterized test --
  unlike other test methods, it does take arguments.\
  We will look at these more later; but JUnit's parameterized tests are
  designed to make it easy to run what are called *data-driven tests*
  (see Wikipedia on [Data-driven testing][ddt]), as well as a subset
  of data-driven testing called *property-based testing*
  (see the explanation given by the [Hypothesis][hypothesis]
  Python-based library for doing this sort of testing).

[hypothesis]: https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


[ddt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_testing]


Consider the following question: if you want to get
all the tests passing, how do you determine what each
method is supposed to *do*, and when it is correct?
(After all, someone writing the test could have made
a mistake in the test code.)



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solutions**:

To find out what each method is supposed to do, the only reliable
option is to read its documentation. If there is no documentation
for the method, then you can never really know what the
developer's intention was.

</div>




## 3. API documentation

Look at the `Calculator.java` class from the lab 1 code.

Can you identify

a.  A Javadoc comment, which documents the API?
b.  A Java comment which is *not* Javadoc?

**Viewing Javadoc comments from an IDE or editor**

In most IDEs and editors, there is no need to explicitly run
the `javadoc` tool in order to view API documentation for a method,
class or annotation.

Instead, you simply need to "hover" your mouse icon over some spot
in the code where the item you're interested in is defined or used,
and a "pop-up" message should appear showing the API documentation.

If you edit the Javadoc comments, the IDE or editor will normally use
the edited, most up-to-date version when showing the documenttion.

**Running the `javadoc` tool**

If you wish, it's also possible to run the `javadoc` tool from
a terminal window, and the tool will generate HTML files
from the source code.

In VS Code, you can open a terminal window by selecting "Terminal" /
"New Terminal" from
the menu.

Type `javadoc -help` to ensure you can invoke the command, and to see
what the options for it are.

To generate documentation for the `Calculator.java` file,
with the documentation being generated in a directory `doc`, first change into the
same directory where the `Calculator.java` file is, and run:

```bash
$ javadoc -d doc -sourcepath . Calculator.java
```

You can then open the generated HTML web pages in a browser to view
them.

<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

**Running Javadoc on a directory**

In general, if you have a directory (e.g. "`src`") containing Java
source files, then if you `cd` to the parent directory, you can get
Javadoc to process *all* the files in that directory with a command
like the following:

```
$ javadoc -d doc -sourcepath src -subpackages ''
```

This assumes your Java code does not have any dependencies on external
libraries (`.jar` files), however. If it does, then you'll need to
specify a *classpath* when invoking `javadoc`. You should refer to
a Java textbook for details on how to do so.

</div>


**Javadoc exercises**

- In your IDE or editor, hover over a usage of a JUnit annotation
  or method (like one of the "assertion") methods. You should be able to
  see the API documentation for it (and perhaps even click to get a
  fuller description) -- can you?

- Identify one class member marked `private`, and make it `public`
  and write a Javadoc comment for it.

  Re-run `javadoc` (and/or re-view the documentation in your IDE/editor) -- what changes do you see in the generated
  documentation?

\newpage

## 4. Fix the code

See if you can fix the code in the `Calculator` class
so that all the tests pass.

For the `subtract` method -- aside from other changes you might
need to make, you might want code something
like the following:


```
  if (/* some condition goes here */) {
    throw new ArithmeticException("can't return a negative result");
  }
```

Try creating your own new tests. In BlueJ, if you right click
on a class, there should be an option to create a test class.
Use the existing tests as an example -- can you think of
other tests we might add?



<div class="solutions">


**Sample solutions**:

\small

Fixing errors:

The code for `subtract` has the numbers in the wrong order.

The code for `subtract` also needs to throw an exception
when the result would be negative.

e.g.

```java
  if (num2 > num1) {
    throw new ArithmeticException("can't return a negative result");
  }
```

</div>



## 5. Requirements revision

Recommended prior study for this unit is CITS4401/3301 Software Requirements and Design, which
explores ways we can express clients' expectations for a system, and ensure they can
be met once the system is designed and implemented.

See if you can come up with examples of requirements which exhibit the following characteristics, and explain you reasoning.
If you're not clear on these concepts, then it's recommended you refer to the textbook
by Pressman, [*Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach*][pressman]. You should be able to access the textbook via UWA's "Unit Readings" site – see [here][readings] for more details.

[pressman]: https://www.amazon.com.au/ISE-Software-Engineering-Practitioners-Approach/dp/1260548007/

[readings]: https://cits5501.arranstewart.io/schedule/#recommended-readings

- Give an example of a requirement that is _ambiguous_.
- Give an example of a requirement that is _vague_.
- Give an example of a requirement that is _functional_.
- Give an example of a requirement that is _non-functional_.



<div class="solutions">


**Sample solutions**:

- *Ambiguity*. Concept recap: An *ambiguous* requirement can be interpreted in multiple valid but conflicting ways.

  Example:
  "The operator identity consists of the operator name and password;
  the password consists of six digits. It should be displayed on the
  security screen and deposited in the login file when an operator
  logs into the system."

  Here, does "it" refer to the identity, or the password? Both are valid interpretations, but we don't know which was intended, so this is ambiguous.

- *Vagueness*. Concept recap: a *vague* requirement is one which is underspecified, and where we often can't draw a sharp dividing line between systems which would meet the requirements, and systems which wouldn't.

  Example: "The system shall permit users to download high-resolution images for each frame of a stored video."

  What qualifies as “high-resolution”? 1080p? 4K? Something else?

  You can find many other examples of vague requirements in the Pressman text and/or the CITS4401/3301 materials – for instance, one which require a system to be "easy to use"
  (this varies by user experience, cultural expectations, and task complexity, and there’s no precise measurable standard or criteria for success; a requirement like this generally needs to be rephrased or supported with usability metrics.)

- *Functional Requirement*. Concept Recap: a *functional* requirement specifies what the system should do – specific behaviours, inputs, and outputs.

  Example: "The system shall send a confirmation email to the user after successful registration."

  This clearly describes a specific action the system must perform. Additionally, it can be directly implemented and tested (e.g. checking email delivery after registration).


- *Non-Functional Requirement*. Concept recap: *non-functional* requirements describe *how* the system performs its functions, or constraints on the way those functions are performed — for instance, requirements related to performance, security, usability, reliability, and so on.

  Example: "The system shall respond to all user actions within 1 second under normal operating conditions."

  This is requirement doesn't describe a system function in terms of inputs and outputs – rather, it imposes a constraint on system behaviour, saying it must happen within specified time limits. This requirement is definitely measurable and testable, but it doesn’t itself describe an actual feature or functionality - if we were testing this, we'd instead look at all the functional requirements that describe responses to user actions, and check whether they meet the constraint that responses happen within 1 second.

</div>




## 6. Concepts review questions

Answer the following questions to test your understanding of
concepts introduced in the lectures and prescribed reading.

For each of the following scenarios,
explain whether you think a *failure*, a *fault*
or an *erroneous state* (or none of these, or more than one) has occurred, and explain why. If
it is a failure --
is it non-conformance with a functional or a non-functional
requirement?

a. The social media site "Witter" allows users to specify
   that their email and date of birth should not be displayed
   publicly. But after a system update, that information
   is now visible for all users.
#. The ride-sharing app Habari runs on a user's mobile phone,
   and communicates with Habari's servers to find nearby divers
   and arrange a ride. However, the communications are not encrypted,
   meaning a tech-savvy user could manipulate the system
   and obtain free rides.
#. Your colleague Mila is writing a method which should
   return the arithmetic mean of numbers in a list:

    ```java
    double total = 0;
    for (double num : number_list) { total += num ; }
    return total / number_list.length
    ```

    However, when the list is of length 0, this code
    returns the result "`INFINITY`".



<div class="solutions">

**Possible solutions and discussion**:

To come to a conclusion for these questions you will
need to make *reasonable assumptions* and state what they
are. Your answer can vary, depending on what assumptions
you make.

The answers below are one possibility; but yours may be
different.

\small

a.  We are told that users can specify that their email and date of birth
    should not be displayed publicly. So if those are displayed
    publicly, then that's a failure: the system is not behaving in
    accordance with requirements.

    We don't know in this case what the exact requirement is, but most
    likely, it is something like:

    > "If the user specifies that their email and address and date of
    > birth should not be displayed publicly on their profile, then
    > those details should not appear on the user's public profile."

    So the failure is non-conformance with a functional requirement.

    Presumably, there's also a problem somewhere in the code for the
    Witter site that causes this failure, but we aren't given details:
    this problem constitutes a *defect*.
    And once execution hits that point in the code, the system will go
    into an *erroneous state*.

    [This scenario is loosely based on a security failure that occurred
    to Google's social networking site, "Google+", in 2018. See the
    article by @NewmanGoogle2018 reporting on this [here][newman]; there
    is also a [Wikipedia page][googleplus-wiki] on the incident.]

[newman]: https://www.wired.com/story/google-plus-bug-52-million-users-data-exposed/
[googleplus-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Google_data_breach


\small

b.  In this scenario, we aren't told exactly what the requirements for
    the Habari system are; but presumably one of them is that
    communications between the mobile app and the Habari company servers
    should be secure.
    (Even if this is not an explicit requirement, it's a reasonable
    expectation of drivers, users, and Habari management.
    Drivers and users presumably don't want details of transactions to
    be visible to third parties, and management presumably would like
    people to pay for rides rather than getting them for free -- else
    the company will go out of business.)

    If the requirement is something like
    "All communications between the mobile app and the Habari servers
    should be made securely"
    then this would be a *non-functional* requirement.
    (We'll discuss later in the unit whether that requirement is precise
    enough.)
    In this context, "functional" means "treating the system as if it
    were a *function*, a black box that takes in inputs and spits out
    outputs"; and "non-functional" means "the manner in which
    some system function executes", rather "not functioning".

    For this unit, you aren't expected to know the details of how secure
    computer communications work, but if you do, you are welcome to
    discuss what you can infer about the defect in the source code which
    causes the above failure.
    (In the scenario given, we probably could point to specific spots in
    the code where things should have been done differently -- spots in
    the code where the programmers developing the Android app and the
    Habari servers should have used appropriate techniques to ensure
    that communications were secure. These would be *defects*.)

    [This scenario is loosely based on one described by Shubham
    Paramhans [-@ParamhansOla2015], who identified flaws in the security
    for the "Ola" ride-sharing app, as described in a
    [Medium.com](https://medium.com) article, "[Fooling the Startup of
    the Year][fooling]".]

[fooling]: https://medium.com/@CodeTheDevil/busting-ola-wallet-1ceea6174b1f


\small

c.  When Mila's method returns the result "`INFINITY`", we'd need to
    know what the method's specifications were in order to know if this
    was a failure or not (i.e., we'd need to look at the method's
    documentation).

    As a matter of mathematics, the
    arithmetic mean for $n$ numbers $a_0$ through $a_n$ is
    defined as $\displaystyle \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$, or
    equivalently
    $\displaystyle \frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n}{n}$ [@WeissteinMean2005].

    So when n = 0, the result is undefined, because dividing by zero is
    not defined.
    If we were writing a specification for this method, what are some
    reasonable things we could require the method to do in this case?

    Here are a few reasonable options:

    i.  The method should return the special floating-point value
        "`INFINITY`". This is Java's default behaviour when
        floating-point numbers are divided by zero. The advantage of
        this approach is it requires no extra work; but "`INFINITY`"
        perhap isn't the best choice, since it doesn't mean exactly the
        same thing as "undefined".
    #.  The method should return the special floating-point value
        "`Nan`" ("Not A Number"). This will require a little extra code,
        but reflects the correct mathematical answer slightly better
        than option (i) does.
    #.  The method should throw an exception (e.g. something like
        Java's `ArithmeticException` class). Throwing an exception
        is usually what maps best to a mathematically undefined result;
        but the caller having to handle the exception may not
        be very convenient.

    We'd need to know more about the business requirements here to
    know which is the best option.

    In any case: if the behaviour of Mila's method does match its
    requirements, then there hasn't been a failure; but if it doesn't
    match them, then there has.

## 7. Moodle activities

All assessments for CITS5501 are submitted via the CSSE department [Moodle][moodle]
server, which can be found at <https://quiz.jinhong.org>.

[moodle]: https://quiz.jinhong.org
[moodle-howto]: https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Using_Quiz#How_students_take_a_quiz

In addition to the assessments, in some weeks *unassessed* exercises and quizzes
may be available on Moodle.

This week, there are two unassessed Moodle quizzes available for you to test your
understanding of prerequisite knowledge and week 1 topics
in CITS5501:

- Java revision quiz, and
- Testing concepts review quiz

**Registering**

:   Visit <https://quiz.jinhong.org> and sign up
    with your UWA email address, self-enrol into CITS5501, then attempt the quizzes
    (in your own time, if you don't finish them in the lab).

    Note that it's **important to self-enrol** on Moodle, so you can access the
    announcements and discussion forum, and submit future assessments.

**Assessed vs unassessed Moodle activities**

:   It's recommended you complete all Moodle activities, even unassessed
    ones, because firstly, they help you gauge how well you understand the material,
    and secondly, the questions and answers are considered to be part of
    the examinable content for the unit.

    *Unassessed* quizzes aim to help you gauge your initial understanding of concepts,
    and may apply a penalty for re-taking code-based questions -- the penalties indicate that your initial
    understanding might not have been as thorough as you thought.
    However, in any *assessed* quiz, test or exam, this is not the case -- if a code-based
    question provides feedback (using the "check" button), you can request feedback as many
    times as you like, and no penalty will be applied.

    Make sure you're familiar with how Moodle quizzes and tests work so you'll be prepared
    when the first *assessed* quiz is given (in week 4). One useful feature to be aware of is
    that when completing a quiz or test, you have access to a "pop out" panel showing the "table
    of contents" for a quiz or test (which provides the names of all headings and sub-headings,
    a view of which questions have been answered and which not, and a way of quickly navigating
    to a particular question).

**Rubric**

:   Assessed activities will be marked based on the [standard CITS5501 rubric][rubric] --
    you can read more about it at <https://cits5501.github.io/faq/#marking-rubric>.
    For long English or code-based questions, the markers will have a model solution
    and guidelines which helps them apply the rubric.

**Other questions about Moodle and assessments**

:   The unit [FAQ page][faq] has more information on how assessments are conducted, and
    on [tests and quizzes][moodle-tests] in particular. You may find that information useful
    to review some time between now and the first assessment (in week 4).
