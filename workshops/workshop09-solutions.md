## Reading

It is strongly suggested you complete the recommended readings for weeks 1-9 *before*
attempting this lab/workshop.

## A. Applicability of formal methods

Discuss the following scenarios. Would you use formal methods for any of the following
systems? If so, which systems, and why? Do you think the enterprise developing the system
would share your view?

a.    The next version of *Confectionery Crush Story*, a web-- and mobile-app--based
      puzzle video game your company develops. The game is available for both Android and
      iOS mobile devices, and the previous version grossed over $US 1 billion in revenue.
#.    *Exemplarex*, software produced for Windows and MacOS operating systems and licensed
      to educational institutions.  The software semi-automatically invigilates exams set
      by the institutions: machine-learning techniques are used to analyse audio and video
      of exam candidates to identify possible academic misconduct.
#.    The online banking website provided by a major Australian bank, EastPac. Over 5
      million customers use the website to perform banking transactions on personal or
      business bank accounts.
#.    A radiation therapy system used to treat cancer patients. The system has two
      principal components:

      - A radiation therapy machine that delivers controlled doses of
        radiation to tumour sites, controlled by an embedded software
        system.
      - A treatment database that includes details of the treatment
        given to each patient.

The aim of the exercise is just to get you to think
about what factors might make formal methods appropriate.

However, some possible answers are:

a.    Unlikely, because speed-to-market is far more important for the games industry
b.    Possibly; but if the market doesn't *demand* formal assurance that the software
      works as specified, it is probably not worth the effort of doing so. In any case,
      the end result of a machine-learning technique will be some sort of model used for
      prediction/classification, and formal methods probably can't prove that the
      classifier is "good".
c.    Possibly lightweight formal methods (e.g. advanced type systems) might be
      appropriate for use in securing web applications.
      In general, banks apply sufficient security techniques to bring losses through fraud
      etc to a tolerable level -- the cost of fully verifying systems is typically not
      worth the return.
d.    Yes, since this is critical software -- lives could be endangered if it malfunctions --
      the use of formal methods may well be appropriate. Any of the methods we have looked
      at (advanced type systems, formal verification, model-based methods) could be
      applied.\
      [Note that in practice, however, most medical software -- even for critical
      applications -- is not, in fact, developed using formal methods.]

## B. Introduction to Dafny

[Dafny][dafny-repo] is a "verification-aware" programming language. The
compiler for the language incorporates a program verifier -- as you write
a program, the verifier checks to see whether what you
have written can be proved correct, and flags any errors.

[dafny-repo]: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny


### Gitpod

You can compile (as well as run) Dafny programs using [Gitpod][gitpod], which provides you
with an online development environment based on [Microsoft VS Code][vs-code]. (Other
installation options are also available, but using Gitpod is normally the easiest
way.[^dafny-install]) 

[vs-code]: https://code.visualstudio.com 
[gitpod]: https://www.gitpod.io/

[^dafny-install]: Dafny can be installed as a VS Code plugin, on several platforms:
  see [here](https://dafny.org/dafny/Installation#Visual-Studio-Code) for instructions.
  This requires you to first install libraries and runtime for Microsoft's .NET platform,
  however. \
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Several Linux distributions also make Dafny available in their default
  repositories. On Ubuntu 20.04 and later, for instance, you can install Dafny with the
  command `sudo apt-get install dafny`. \
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of other possible installation options are provided on the Dafny
  [installation page](https://dafny.org/dafny/Installation).

Visit <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/arranstewart-dev/dafny-gitpod> in your
browser.  Gitpod will download a Docker image containing the Dafny compiler, and create an
online IDE environment (this may take a couple of minutes).

\newpage

\end{center}

![](images/dafny-gitpod.png){ width=100% }

Once it appears, open the "sample.dfy" file in the editor, and an "editor extension"
will be installed which tells the editor how to highlight Dafny code and show errors.

(You can ignore any error messages saying the "dafny-lang.ide-cscode extension is not synced" --
those are a limitation of the VS Code setup, and can't easily be got rid of.)

Toward the bottom of the screen is also a "Terminal" tab, which gives you
command-line access to the virtual machine in which Microsoft VS Code is running.
Typing `dafny /help` in the terminal will display the compiler online help
(warning: it's very long).

#### Dafny assertions

Take a look at the sample source file in VS Code:


```c#
method Main() {
  print "hello, Dafny\n";
  assert 10 < 2;
}
```

You should see that the Dafny compiler reports an
*assertion violation*	in line 3; the assertion "$10 < 2$"
is not true.
Now comment out the assertion (using double forward-slashes -- "`//`" --
the same as Java.) The code should now compile.

In Dafny, assertions are checked not at run-time (as they are in many languages), but at
compile time: if the Dafny compiler cannot *prove* to its satisfaction that an assertion
holds, it will refuse to compile the source code.

#### Command line compiler

In the "Terminal" tab, you should be able to invoke the `dafny` command, which
lets you compile code to different targets (such as Java, C# and Go) and run the program.
The command

```bash
$ dafny /version
```

should print the Dafny version and verify the command works. And the command

```bash
$ dafny sample.dfy
```

will verify and compile the `sample.dfy` -- it is actually short for the command:

```bash
$ dafny /compile:1 hello.dfy
```

Either command should produce output like the following:

```plain
Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 0 errors
Compiled assembly into sample.dll
```

By default, Dafny compiles programs into libraries for use on Windows
(`.dll` files). If you list the directory contents, you will see `sample.dll`,
and a file `sample.runtimeconfig.json` which the compiler creates.

The following command verifies, compiles, *and* runs your program:

```bash
$ dafny /compile:3 sample.dfy
```

#### `Main` method

Change the name of the `Main` method to `Random` (or any other name you wish).

Try compiling, verifying and running the program again:


```bash
$ dafny /compile:3 sample.dfy
```

Although the program verifies and compiles properly, it will not execute and produce any output,
because the Dafny runtime looks for a `Main` method to execute. If it does not find one,
no warning or error is produced (you might have intended to create a library, rather than a program),
but nothing will be executed.


## C. Preconditions

Try compiling and running the following code:

```
method Main() {
  PrintInt(-1);
}

method PrintInt(x : int)
{
  print "the int is: \n";
  print x;
}
```

The int -1 should be printed with a message. Now add a precondition to PrintInt, "`requires x >= 0`":

```
method Main() {
  PrintInt(-1);
}

method PrintInt(x : int)
  requires x >= 0
{
  print "the int is: \n";
  print x;
}
```

If you try compiling again, you will see that Dafny won't permit you to call the
`PrintInt` method, unless it can verify all the preconditions hold. Change the `int` being
passed from -1 to 1, and you should see the code now compiles.

Create a new file `square.dfy` consisting of the following code.

```c#
method SquareMe(n:int)
{
  assert n*n > 0;
}
```

and try to verify the program using:

```bash
$ dafny square.dfy
```

It should generate the messages:

```plain
square.dfy(3,13): Error: assertion might not hold
Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 1 error
```

Even though the assertion is true for *almost* all values of `n`, it fails for `n == 0`, and just one
failure is enough to make the assertion false. Dafny requires that assertions be true for *all*
possible inputs.

An assertion which *is* true, however, is the following -- try inserting it instead:

```c#
assert n!=0 ==> n*n>0
```

This reads "`n*n` is greater than 0, ***if*** `n` does not equal 0". This assertion
is true, so Dafny should allow the program to be verified and compiled.


\newpage

## D. Using Dafny features

The following Dafny code is intended to find
the position of the largest element of an array. It
is only guaranteed to produce a result if the array is *non-empty*,
however. We won't compile this (yet), but look
at the following code:


```
method FindMax(arr: array<int>) returns (r: int)
{
  var max_val : int := arr[0];
  var max_idx : int := 0;

  var i : int       := 1;

  while (i < arr.Length)
  {
    if arr[i] > max_val
      {
        max_idx := i;
        max_val := arr[i];
      }
    i := i + 1;  
  }
  return max_idx;
}
```

At what points in the code might we insert the following, and
what Dafny keywords would be used?

-   preconditions
-   postconditions
-   loop invariants
-   assertions

See if you can state what the preconditions and
postconditions are (in English is fine).





`~\vspace{1ex}`{=latex}
\solbox
<div class="solutions">


**Solution:**

Correct locations would be: 

```
method FindMax(arr: array<int>) returns (r: int)
   requires /* **preconditions go here** */
   ensures /* **postconditions go here** */
{

  var max_val : int := arr[0];
  var max_idx : int := 0;

  var i : int       := 1;

  /* **assertions could go anywhere in the body** */

  while (i < arr.Length)
    invariant /* **loop invariants go here** */
  {
    if arr[i] > max_val
      {
        max_idx := i;
        max_val := arr[i];
      }
    i := i + 1;  
  }
  return max_idx;
}
```

Preconditions (in English):

- The array is of length 1 or more.

Postcondition (in English):

- The return value `r` is greater than or equal
  to every element of the array.

**Challenge exercise**:  If you have some experience with
formal logic and would like a challenge, try verifying the above code
using the online Dafny verifier. You
will probably want to work through the online Dafny tutorial
first.
This will explain how to use the `forall` keyword,
which we have not covered, but which is needed for the
challenge.



`~\vspace{1ex}`{=latex}
\solbox
<div class="solutions">

**Sample solution:**

Fully verified code:

```
method FindMax(arr: array<int>) returns (r: int)
   requires arr.Length > 0
   ensures (0 <= r < arr.Length) && 
    (forall k :: 0 <= k < arr.Length ==> arr[r] >= arr[k])
{

  var max_val : int := arr[0];
  var max_idx : int := 0;

  var i : int       := 1;

  assert i >= 1;
  assert max_idx <= i;

  while (i < arr.Length)
    // probably could get away with fewer loop invariants
    invariant 1 <= i <= arr.Length
    invariant 0 <= max_idx  <= arr.Length
    invariant 0 <= max_idx  <= i
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k <= i-1 ==> max_val >= arr[k]
    invariant (0 <= max_idx < arr.Length) 
        && (max_val == arr[max_idx]) 
        && (forall k :: 0 <= k <= i-1 ==> arr[max_idx] >= arr[k])
  {
    if arr[i] > max_val
      {
        max_idx := i;
        max_val := arr[i];
      }
    i := i + 1;  
  }
  return max_idx;
}
```

## E. Writing Dafny methods

The following code does not yet compile:

```
method Max(a: int, b:int) returns (c: int)
  ensures c >= a
{
  return 0; 
}
```

Write the body of the method Max. It should take two integer parameters and
return their maximum. Add appropriate annotations (one is
already provided) and make sure your
code verifies. Refer to the documentation and tutorials,
if necessary.



\newpage

\solbox
<div class="solutions">

Solution:

```
method Max(a: int, b:int) returns (c: int)
  ensures c >= a
  ensures c >= b
{
  if (b > a) {
    return b;
  } else {
    return a;
  }    
}
```

</div>

## F. Project work

If you haven't yet started on the CITS5501 unit [project][project], now would be a good
time to read through the specification.

For project questions requiring *code*: a Moodle "test area" will be available soon on the
CSSE Moodle server which will allow you to run some basic tests of your code. The test
area won't include space for "long-form" English answers, though, since those don't admit
of automated testing.

For project questions requiring *long-form answers in English*: a final submission area will
be made available on Moodle a week before the submission date, where you can submit both
code and long English answers to questions. Long-form English answers are written using
Moodle's [**text editor plugins**][moodle-editor], of which there are several available.
The default editor is called **Atto**, but you might find others more to your taste. The
**TinyMCE** editor provides finer-grained control over the formatting of your answers,
and it's also possible to write your answers in a markup language such as
[Markdown][markdown].
You can read [here][moodle-editors] about the different editors available, and how to
select them in your Moodle preferences.
