# Randomized testing

### ISP

When we looked at Input Space Partitioning (ISP),
we saw techniques for manually creating test cases
for the functions in a software component.

However, another possibility is to create tests
*randomly*.

The technique of choosing elements
from the input domain randomly, and using them as tests --
is known as \alert{random testing}.

### Random testing

Some advantages of \alert{random testing}:

- Very easy to generate test cases
  - (However, they may not tell you anything useful)
- Lacks human biases -- doesn't have preconceptions about
  what input values might be "better"

### Property-based testing

Suppose we are trying to apply the idea of random testing
to a method we saw in lecture 5, `collapseSpaces`:[^collsp]

::: code

####

\small

``` {.java}
/** Remove/collapse multiple spaces.
*
* @param String string to remove multiple spaces from.
* @return String */
public static String collapseSpaces(String argStr);
```

:::


[^collsp]: From the \texttt{StringUtils} class of Apache Velocity
  (<http://velocity.apache.org/>), version 1.3.1.


### Example -- collapseSpaces

::: code

####

\footnotesize

``` {.java}
/** Remove/collapse multiple spaces.
*
* @param String string to remove multiple spaces from.
* @return String */
public static String collapseSpaces(String argStr);
```

:::

One obvious problem with random testing is how to know what the
expected value of a test should be.

For instance, suppose we generate the random string
\texttt{"R1Z cz  vaqxCwugL"} ... how do we know what the
expected result should be of passing this to `collapseSpaces`,
except by invoking `collapseSpaces`?

### Example -- collapseSpaces

To apply the idea behind \alert{property-based testing}, we
don't try to *predict* what the expected result should be.

Rather, we try to formulate *laws* or *properties* which
should always hold between the input and the output of a function.

For instance, suppose we ran `collapseSpaces` on some
arbitrary string, and discovered that the output string was *longer*
than the input string -- should that be possible?

\pause

It should not. So we can state this as a "law" about
`collapseSpaces`:

::: block

####

The output of `collapseSpaces` should never be longer than
the input.

:::

### Example -- collapseSpaces

What other "laws" can we come up with?

\pause

Some possibilities:

- `collapseSpaces` should never remove a non-space character.
  - How to test this?
  - We can run a `stripSpaces` function (hopefully trivial to
    implement) on the input and the output; if the law holds,
    the results should be identical.

### Example -- collapseSpaces

So the task of doing property-based testing reduces to the
following:

- For each of our two tests (let's call them
  "`outputNeverLongThanInput`" and
  "`neverRemovesNonSpace`") ...
- ... generate many random strings.
  - We can generate *completely* random strings, drawn from
    any possible Unicode "character"
  - We can also generate strings that have a high chance of
    containing contiguous spaces 
- Invoke `collapseSpaces` on the random string
- Assert that the "law" we have stated, relating input and output,
  holds.
  - (These "laws" are another sort of \alert{invariant} --
    a rule about our software that always should hold true
    if the software is correct.)

### Benefits of property-based testing

We now gain the benefits of random testing (easy to generate test
cases), without the drawback of needing an "oracle" to tell
us the expected result for our test.

Other benefits:

- In practice, a quick and fairly easy way of
  checking our functions for silly mistakes -- *and* it forces us to
  clarify our thinking about what the preconditions and postconditions
  of our function are.

### Benefits of property-based testing

- Lets us "bootstrap" tricky functions:
  - Write a not necessarily efficient, but very straightforward
    implementation of a tricky function (say, for `editDistance()`,
    the "edit distance between two strings")
  - Start developing a better, more efficient version of the
    function ("`fastEditDistance`")
  - Use property-based testing to check that the following "law"
    holds: "the result of applying `fastEditDistance` is always the
    same as the result of applying `editDistance`".

### Property-based testing frameworks

Testing frameworks that perform property-based testing include:

-   [Hypothesis][hypothesis], for Python
-   [QuickTheories][quicktheories] and [jqwik][jqwik], for Java
-   [jsverify][jsverify], for JavaScript
-   [QuickCheck][quickcheck], the inspiration for most of the others,
    for Haskelll
-   ... Many more [listed][pbtest-list] by David R. MacIver, the developer of
    Hypothesis.
-   We will look at some of these testing frameworks in more detail.

### Property-based testing in JUnit 5

JUnit 5 doesn't directly support property-based testing --
the nearest we could get is to use parameterized JUnit tests.

We could use the `@MethodSource` annotation to specify that
our tests should draw their paramaters from some particular
method (call it `generateRandomString`, say), and then
use the `java.util.Random` class to generate our random strings.

This isn't particularly convenient, however -- a good property-based
testing framework will provide us with many methods for generating
random data of different sorts, perhaps then checking it for
usefulness ("Does this string actually contain some spaces?")
and then applying our "laws" to it.

### QuickTheories example

QuickTheories can be used with JUnit as well as
other test frameworks (e.g. TestNG).

An example (from the QuickTheories documentation):

::: block

####

\small

```java
import static org.quicktheories.QuickTheory.qt;
import static org.quicktheories.generators.SourceDSL.*;

public class SomeTests {
  @Test
  public void addingTwoPositiveIntsGivesAPositiveInt(){
    qt()
    .forAll(integers().allPositive()
          , integers().allPositive())
    .check((i,j) -> i + j > 0); 
  }
}
```

### Components of property-based testing frameworks

Most property-based testing frameworks include the
following components:

- Generator: a way of generating random inputs to a function.

  These range from the very basic (e.g. "all `int`s"), to
  those with simple conditions (e.g. "all event `int`s"), to
  complex (e.g. "all instances of the `JPEG` class (each of which
  represents a valid JPEG graphic").

  Much the same techniques come in handy here as we saw with
  generators for grammars.

- Checker: a way of testing whether a random input satisfies
  the condition you've defined.

  QuickTheories allows you to use JUnit `assert...` methods to do this.

### Components of property-based testing frameworks


- Shrinker: Once a test failure is found, good property-based testing frameworks
  will attempt to *shrink* the input into the smallest possible that will
  reproduce the error.

  Let's see an example of this.


### Shrinking

Suppose we want to test methods for a class which represents (for instance)
a Word document, or a JPEG graphic.

A very common property for file formats is that they should "round-trip":
if we write a JPEG object out to a file[^or_bytes], then read it back in,
we should get a new object which is identical to the original.

If we manage to generate a JPEG where this *doesn't* work, it could
be tricky to track down exactly what part or aspect of the file is causing the failure.

So a shrinker will attempt to simplify a failing input to get a slightly
smaller input -- see if *that* still fails -- and continue until we
have the smallest input that still fails our test. 

[^or_bytes]: Or, more typically, we would
  convert it to a sequence of bytes in memory, without ever
  writing it to a file; this makes for faster tests.


<!--

One technique that comes in useful when doing property-based
testing is to make use of syntax-based *generators*.

We saw that we can use syntax-based rules to generate complex data
structures (e.g. for Word documents, or JPEG graphics files).

We can apply similar techniques to quickly generate almost any data
structure we like.

Good property-based testing libraries also help us create rules
so the framework can *shrink* test
values for which a test fails -|- reduce them to a smaller, simpler
example for which the test *still* fails.

-->

### `reverse` example

Suppose we have a method `String reverse(String s)` that reverses
a string -- can you think of any general "law" we can state that
relates the input to the output?

\pause

- One is: if we reverse an already-reversed string, we get the
  original input back again.

  ```java
    String testSelfInverse(String s) {
      String newString = reverse(reverse(s));
      assertEqual(s, newString);
    }
  ```

- Another is: the output string should always be the same
  length as the input string.


### List.remove example

\small

-   Consider the following method specification:

    `List.remove(Object o)`: Search the list for elements which
    are equal to object `o` (using `.equals()`). If there are any,
    then the first such element is removed. Otherwise, the method
    does nothing.
-   If $L_{before}$ is the length of the list before we execute
    `remove()`, and $L_{after}$ is the length of the list after we
    execute it, then the following invariant holds:\
    $\quad (L_{after} = L_{before}) \vee (L_{after} = L_{before} - 1)$ \
    Let's call this invariant $Inv_1$, for short.
-   It is certainly good practice to write tests for `remove()`
    based on Input Space Partitioning -- e.g. constructing
    small lists that do or don't contain the element being
    searched for, and constructing test inputs based on that.

### Property-based testing

-   But if we can identify invariants like $Inv_1$, that we think
    will *always* hold, then we can generate random data to
    improve our confidence that this is so.
-   If our test framework generates a few thousand sample lists,
    and our invariant holds for all of them, we can be fairly confident
    that this theory about our method is true.\
    (We cannot be *certain* -- we might have failed to generate
    a test case that exercises some particular fault -- perhaps
    our method fails on extremely long lists, and we never generated
    those --
    but our confidence is definitely improved.)

### Other uses of random testing

\small

Random testing can be very useful when we want to generate large
volumes of valid or invalid data.

For instance for:

- Load testing -- How does our software perform under high loads --
  the largest volumes of data we expect to receive? \
  (We would like to ensure our software correctly handles the expected load.)
- Stress testing -- How does our software behave when we *exceed*
  the expected maximum? \
  (We often would still like our system to *degrade gracefully*,
  even though it may not be able to handle all the results.)
- Robustness testing -- How well does our system handle malformed
  inputs? \
  (We don't expect that it will give "correct" results -- but we
  usually expect it not to suffer, say, a segmentation fault/crash.)

### Other uses of random testing

Question: have you used software that crashed or otherwise
misbehaved when given large inputs?

\pause

If so, it probably could have benefitted from load testing,
stress testing, and/or robustness testing.

# Fuzzing

### Fuzzing

\small

One sort of robustness testing is called \alert{fuzzing} or
\alert{fuzz testing}. It usually makes use of randomly generated
inputs.

The general idea is this:

- Start with a program under test -- e.g. one that converts PNG files
  to `.bmp` (bitmap) files.
- Provide it with invalid or unexpected data, and monitor the
  program's behaviour.
- If it crashes, throws expections that reach the end user, or fails
  assertions we have included in our code (statements that test
  invariants) -- it's not handling the input data \alert{robustly}.
- (We could also monitor the program for other bad behaviour such as
  *memory leaks* -- acquiring and not releasing RAM, leading to the
  program "hogging" a computer's available memory).


### Variants

There are many clever variants on this basic idea.

- In the simplest case, we could just use completely random inputs --
  but that's rarely effective, as they often don't look at all
  similar to valid inputs, and don't trigger "interesting" execution
  paths
- **Mutation-based fuzzers.** We can start with a just a small
  sample of inputs (e.g. some valid and invalid JPEG files, using
  our previous example), and randomly alter them to produce new
  inputs.
  - Can repeatedly mutate our existing inputs to produce more
    and more "generations" of input files
  - Useful for getting our inputs "past" a program's initial
    syntax checks
  - Usually doesn't involve any "deep" understanding of the input
    structure

### Variants

- **"Smart" vs "dumb" fuzzers.** Our fuzzer might have some
  "understanding" of the input structure (i.e. the syntax of a JPEG
  file) to aid it in generating new inputs. 
- **White-, grey-, or black-box**.
  - In the simplest case (black-box), we just monitor a program for
    crashes, treating it as a "black box" without understanding its
    internal structure.
  - But ideally, we would like our fuzzer to get good *code coverage*
    of the program under test.
  - White- and grey-box fuzzers will analyse or *instrument* the
    code of the program under test, and try to generate inputs
    which will e.g. take the program down execution paths it hasn't
    been before.

### Some fuzz-testing tools

- [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) (standing for "American Fuzzy Lop")
- [javafuzz](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/fuzzers/javafuzz) --
  coverage guided fuzzer for java
- [JQF](https://github.com/rohanpadhye/JQF) -- coverage-guided
  semantic fuzzing for Java 
- [honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz) -- evolutionary,
  feedback-driven fuzzing based on code coverage

### Advaantages of fuzz testing

- Simple to do -- in the simplest case, just provide some sample
  inputs, and the path to your program, and start the fuzzer going.
- Cheap -- doesn't require extensive computational resources
- Effective -- very good for finding security flaws in
  memory-unchecked languages (e.g. C, C`++`).
