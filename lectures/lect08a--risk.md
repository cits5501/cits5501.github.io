### Overview

- Why look at risk?
- What is risk?
- Strategies for dealing with risk

### Motivation

Why do we look at risk?

::: incremental

-   Because every project, even the simplest, involves risks
-   Because people are usually not good at allowing for them
-   Because risk assessment determines what other testing
    and quality assurance activities you undertake

:::

### Motivation

In fact *every* technique we look at in this unit can be seen as
a way to try to reduce project risks.

- Why do we have system or method specifications?
  - To try to avoid miscommunication risks -- the risk that
    our description of something will be misunderstood because
    it is ambiguous, or incomplete, or contradictory
- Why do we write tests? Why do code reviews?
  - To try to discover faults *early*, and reduce the risk of expensive defect
    correction late in the project, or after a project is released.

### Motivation

And the best answer to "When have we done enough testing?" or "When have we
done enough code review?" is -- when we've reduced the risk to a level
that we can accept.

If some parts or aspects of a project are particularly high risk -- we can dedicate
extra resources or techniques to those areas to reduce the risk.

### Example

-   What sort of requirements documentation should we require for,
    say, a website?

<!-- -->

-   Is there complicated or confusing terminology involved? Is there a
    risk of miscommunication or misunderstanding between us and our
    client? (e.g. perhaps
    for a website to be used internally by a financial services
    enterprise)\
    We might try to reduce the risk of miscommunication by ensuring
    we have *glossaries* of terms, and that client representatives
    and developers agree on their understanding of these.

### Example

-   Is the domain, or the technologies we're likely to have to use,
    complicated? Is there a risk we have modelled it incorrectly? (Example:
    software to manage telephone exchange systems; systems which are
    inherently concurrent, as they are notoriously difficult to reason
    about.) \
    We might reduce risk by putting additional effort into modelling the
    domain and/or the system -- perhaps through a notation such as UML,
    perhaps even through formal (i.e. mathematical) specifications
    of the domain and/or system.

### Example

-   On the other hand, if this is a website for a local kids' football
    club, then many of these risks are unlikely to be relevant, or
    to cause significant problems if they do -- so effort on those
    activities would be misplaced.

### What is risk?

-   Something that \alert{\emph{might}} happen, which would cause \alert{loss}
    -   If it will *definitely* happen, that's not a risk -- it's usually
        called a "constraint"
    -   If it doesn't result in some kind of unwanted consequence (i.e., a
        loss), it's also not a risk

### How can we categorize risk?

Our aim here is not to try and come up with some kind of "perfect"
way of classifying risks. \
The lines between our categories will almost certainly be fuzzy.

The idea is rather that these categories can be useful in \alert{helping
us think of} (or remember) \alert{possible risks} that might occur in a project.

The hope is that if we go through categories (at least somewhat) methodically,
we're more likely to identify possible risks.

### What are some sorts of risk?

One categorization (Pressman):

-   Project risks
    -   Things that could affect the project plan or schedule
-   Technical risks
    -   Risks resulting from the problem being *harder to solve* than we
        thought
-   Business risks
    -   Things that threaten the viability, as a product, of the software
        to be built
    -   (Could be commercial viability, but also applies to in-house or
        even open source software)

Let's see some examples.

### Sorts of risk -- project risks

Project risks:

-   Things that could affect the *project plan and/or schedule*,
    causing it to slip and costs to increase
-   Examples: personnel move or resign, resources turn out to be more
    expensive/take longer to acquire than estimated, exchange rates shift

### Sorts of risk -- technical risks

Technical risks:

-   Risks resulting from the problem being *harder to solve* than we
    thought
-   They threaten the quality and timeliness of the software to be
    produced
-   If they eventuate, implementation may become difficult or
    impossible
-   Examples: design turns out to be infeasible, dependencies have
    bugs, language/framework turns out to be difficult to maintain

### Sorts of risk -- business risks

Business risks
-   Things that threaten the viability, as a product, of the software
    to be built (even if there are no technical or project barriers
    to it being implemented on time and within budget)
-   Examples: over-estimating the market for a product; being beaten
    to release by a competitor

### Exercise -- UWA assignment/project risks

How do Pressman's categories apply to doing CSSE projects or assignment?

- Project risks (plan or schedule)
- Technical (difficulties solving problem)
- Business (viability of product)

### What sort of risks can we know about?

Robert N. Charette (1989) suggests classifying risks
in terms of how can (or can't) find out about them:

-   Known risks
    -   Those risks that can be uncovered after careful evaluation of
        the project plan, the business and technical environment in
        which the project is being developed, and other reliable
        information sources (e.g., unrealistic delivery date)
-   Predictable risks
    -   Those risks that are extrapolated from past project experience
        (e.g., past turnover)
-   Unpredictable risks
    -   Those risks that can and do occur, but are extremely difficult
        to identify in advance

### What strategies can we adopt to deal with risk?

-   *\alert{Reactive}* risk strategies
    -   "Don't worry, I'll think of something"
    -   The majority of software teams and managers rely on this
        approach
    -   Nothing is done about risks until something goes wrong
        -   The team then flies into action in an attempt to correct the
            problem rapidly ("fire fighting")
-   *\alert{Proactive}* risk strategies
    -   Steps for risk management are followed
    -   Primary objective is to *reduce* risk and to have a contingency
        plan in place to handle unavoidable risks in a controlled and
        effective manner

### What strategies can we adopt to deal with risk?

It might seem obvious that we should be proactive.

But when we think about how the future course of a project will go,
most people tend to focus on scenarios in which most things
go *right*, not the scenarios where things go *wrong*.

\break

Query -- does this apply to how you plan work on
projects or assignments? Or do you allow for contingencies
and things going wrong?

(Some people do this more naturally than others. We will look at this in the workshop.)

### Steps for risk management

1.  Identify possible risks; recognize what can go wrong
#.  Analyze each risk to estimate the probability that it will occur and
    the impact (i.e., damage) that it will do if it does occur
#.  Rank the risks by probability and impact
    -   Impact may be negligible, marginal, critical, and catastrophic
#.  Develop a plan to manage (some of) those risks

### Risk identification

-   A systematic attempt to identify risks to the project
-   Because if they aren't identified, how can they be planned for?
-   Two main sorts of risk:
    -   Generic risks
        -   Risks that are common to every software project
    -   Product-specific risks
        -   Risks that can be identified only by those a with a clear
            understanding of the technology, the people, and environment
            specific to the software that is to be built

### Risk identification (2)

-   One way of identifying risks -- use a *risk checklist*
-   Focuses on known and predictable risks in specific subcategories

### Risk checklists

\footnotesize

Some typical categories of items on risk checklists:

-   Product size -- risks associated with overall size of the software
    to be built
-   Business impact -- risks associated with constraints imposed by
    management or the marketplace
-   Customer characteristics -- risks associated with sophistication of
    the customer and the developer's ability to communicate with the
    customer in a timely manner
-   Process definition -- risks associated with the degree to which the
    software process has been defined and is followed
-   Development environment -- risks associated with availability and
    quality of the tools to be used to build the project
-   Technology to be built -- risks associated with complexity of the
    system to be built and the "newness" of the technology in the
    system
-   Staff size and experience -- risks associated with overall technical
    and project experience of the software engineers who will do the
    work

### A project risk questionnaire


```{=latex}
\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
```

\footnotesize

1.  Have top software and customer managers formally committed to
    support the project?
#.  Are end-users enthusiastically committed to the project and the
    system/product to be built?
#.  Are requirements fully understood by the software engineering team
    and its customers?
#.  Have customers been involved fully in the definition of
    requirements?
#.  Do end-users have realistic expectations?
#.  Is the project scope stable?


```{=latex}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
```

\footnotesize


7.  Does the software engineering team have the right mix of skills?
#.  Are project requirements stable?
#.  Does the project team have experience with the technology to be
    implemented?
#.  Is the number of people on the project team adequate to do the job?
#.  Do all customer/user constituencies agree on the importance of the
    project and on the requirements for the system/product to be built?


```{=latex}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
```

### Risk estimation

-   Risk estimation attempts to rate, for each risk:
    -   The probability that it eventuates
    -   The magnitude of loss associated with the risk, should
        it eventuate
-   The project planner, managers, and technical staff perform 
    risk estimation so that risks can be prioritized, and 
    limited resources be allocated where they will have the most impact


### Risk tables

-   A *risk table* provides a project manager with a simple technique for
    risk projection
-   It consists of five columns
    -   Risk summary -- short description of the risk
    -   Risk category -- (see the slides on risk categorization) 
    -   Probability -- estimation of risk occurrence based on group
        input
    -   Categorization of impact -- e.g. (1) catastrophic (2) critical
        \(3\) marginal (4) negligible
    -   RMMM -- pointer to a paragraph in the Risk Mitigation,
        Monitoring, and Management Plan

### Developing a Risk Table

-   List all risks in the first column (by way of the help of the risk
    item checklists)
-   Mark the category of each risk
-   Estimate the probability of each risk occurring
-   Assess the impact of each risk based on an averaging of the four
    risk components  to determine an overall impact value
-   Sort the rows by probability and impact in descending order
-   Draw a horizontal cutoff line in the table that indicates the risks
    that will be given further attention

### Assessing risk impact

\small

-   Three factors affect the consequences that are likely if a risk does
    occur
    -   Its nature -- This indicates the problems that are likely if the
        risk occurs
    -   Its scope -- This combines the severity of the risk (how serious
        was it) with its overall distribution (how much was affected)
    -   Its timing -- This considers when and for how long the impact
        will be felt
-   The overall risk exposure formula is RE = P $\times$ C, where
    -   P = the probability of occurrence for a risk
    -   C = the cost to the project should the risk actually occur

-   Example
    -   P = 80% probability that 18 of 60 software components will have
        to be developed
    -   C = Total cost of developing 18 components is $25,000
    -   RE = .80 $\times$ $25,000 = $20,000


### Risk mitigation, monitoring, and management

An effective risk strategy for dealing with risk must consider three issues

-   (Note: these are not mutually exclusive)
    -   Risk mitigation (i.e., avoidance)
    -   Risk monitoring
    -   Risk management and contingency planning
-   Risk mitigation (avoidance) is the primary strategy and is achieved
    through a plan

### Example

Example: Risk of high staff turnover

-   Meet with current staff to determine causes for turnover (e.g., poor
    working conditions, low pay, competitive job market)
-   Mitigate those causes that are under our control before the project
    starts
-   Once the project commences, assume turnover will occur and develop
    techniques to ensure continuity when people leave
-   Organize project teams so that information about each development
    activity is widely dispersed
-   Define documentation standards and establish mechanisms to ensure
    that documents are developed in a timely manner
-   Conduct peer reviews of all work (so that more than one person is
    "up to speed")
-   Assign a backup staff member for every critical technologist
