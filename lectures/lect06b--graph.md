### Overview

- Graph-based testing -- we identify inputs which
  will exercise particular *paths* through a graph representing
  the software in some way.
- The graph could represent

  - control flow through a program
  - data flow between variables
  - an activity diagram, showing the workflow when a user
    interacts with the system
  - a state diagram, showing states of a system and
    transitions between them

### Graph definition

A graph consists of:

-   A set $N$ of nodes
-   A set $E$ of edges, each edge being an "arrow" from one node to
    another

### Graph-based testing

We will start by considering control flow. Our approach is:

1.  Use the source code (or pseudocode) to produce a control flow graph.
2.  Using the graph produce a set of tests for the given program.

### Constructing the graph

-   In a control flow graph, nodes represent points in the program
    control flow can go "from" or "to"
-   Loops, thrown exceptions and gotos (in languages that have them)
    are locations control flow can go *from* -- statements representing
    these spots are "sources"
-   Locations control flow can go *to* are "sinks" 

### Sequence control flow graphs

-   The flow graph for a sequence of statements
    "`s1; s2;`" is

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](images/graph-sequence.eps){ width=12% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

### `if-then` control flow graphs

\footnotesize

-   given pseudocode like

    ```python
      if c then:
        s1
      s2
    ```

    we get the following graph

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](images/graph-if-then.eps){ width=30% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

### `if-then-else` control flow graphs

\footnotesize

-   ~~~
    if c then:
      s1
    else:
      s2
    s3
    ~~~

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](images/graph-if-then-else.eps){ width=40% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}


### What about loops?

-   Edges will obviously go "backward" in the graph
    (usually, towards the "top")

### `while-do` control flow graphs

\footnotesize

-   ~~~
    while c do:
      s1
    s2
    ~~~

`\begin{center}`{=latex}
![](images/graph-while.eps){ width=30% }
`\end{center}`{=latex}

### other structures

-   Most other control flow structures can be written into one 
    of these forms (including "case" statements, `break`ing out of loops, "`for`" loops, etc)

### other structures -- example { .fragile }

```{=latex}
\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.4\textwidth}
```

A "case" statement:

``` 
  case x of:
    val1: s1; break
    val2: s2; break
    default: s3
  s4  
```

```{=latex}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
```

Can be written as nested `if-else`

```
  if x == v1:
    s1
  else:
    if x == v2:
      s2
    else:
      s3
  s4
```




```{=latex}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
```

### Using the graph

-   To find a new test, examine the graph edges that *haven't* been
    exercised yet, and try to devise a test that exercises it
-   In general, we'd actually like to find a test that exercises
    as *few* edges as possible

- why?

    \pause

    -   Tests that exercise a large number of edges usually represent "common"
        scenarios -- we'd actually like to find less common cases
        (i.e. get more "value" out of the test)
    -   Ideally, we want tests to be small and independent, so that when
        something goes wrong, we can localize the fault.

### Example -- sorting algorithm

::: code

####

```
S1  i = 2
C1  while (i <= n):
S2    j = i - 1
C2    while j >= 1 and A[j] >= A[j+1]:
S3      temp = A[j]
S4      A[j] = A[j+1]
S5      A[j+1] = temp
S6      j = j-1
S7    i = i + 1
```

### Example -- binary search

**Inputs**

-   `n`, the length of the following array.
-   `A`, an integer array with entries `A[1], ..., A[n]` such that 
    `A[i] < A[i+1]` for `i` between `1` and `n-1` \
    (i.e., it's sorted in ascending order, and 1-based)
-   `key`, an integer to search for (the "needle")

**Outputs**

-   index, an integer between 0 and n such that:

    -   if `index = 0` then key does not equal any entry of the array A
    -   if `index` is between `1` and `n` then `A[index] = key`

### Example -- binary search (2)

\footnotesize

::: code

####

```
found = false
low = 1
high = n
while ((low <= high) and not found):
  medium = floor((low + high)/2)
  if A[medium] == key: 
     index = medium
     found = true
  else:
     if A[medium] < key then
       low = medium + 1
     else:
       high = medium - 1

if not found:
  index := 0
```

## Graph-based testing criteria

### Graph-based testing criteria

-   Some possible criteria include:

    -   node coverage - our test set traverses every node\
        (if using program control flow: statement coverage
        is similar, but coarser)
    -   edge coverage - we traverse every edge
    -   egde-pair coverage - we traverse every possible *pair* of edges

-   We might use the informal heuristic of executing each loop
    0 times, once, more than once (sometimes called "loop coverage")

### Prime paths

Definitions:

-   \alert{Simple path}: A path from node $n_i$ to $n_j$ is **simple** if no node appears
    more than once, except possibly the first and last nodes are the
    same

    -   No *internal* loops in our path
    -   A loop is a simple path 

    \pause

-   \alert{Prime path}: A simple path that does not appear as a proper subpath
    of any other simple path

### Prime path coverage

-   \alert{Prime Path Coverage (PPC)}: Every prime path in the graph is
    visited.

-   It subsumes node and edge coverage
-   But not edge-pair coverage -- we could have nodes ($m$,$n$),
    where $m$ loops to itself, and edge pair coverage requires the
    path ($m$,$m$,$n$) to be exercised.
-   when it comes to devising *tests*, some tests may end up
    exercising multiple prime paths. But that's okay --
    as long as all prime paths are visited, we've satisfied the
    criterion.

### Control flow graphs

In a control flow graph, different graph coverage criteria will
correspond to:

-   Node coverage: Execute every statement \
    (in fact, node coverage is stronger, since one statement
    may expand to multiple nodes)
-   Edge coverage: Execute every branch

Note that complex boolean conditions in branches are still treated
as a single node. (Effectively, the boolean condition is a
"black box".)

*Logic* coverage conditions (used, for instance, in avionics)
look at these conditions in finer-grained detail.
