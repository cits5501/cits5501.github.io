### Overview

\renewcommand{\figurename}{Figgy}

- Alloy specification language and Alloy analyser

### Alloy idea

The idea behind Alloy is that:

- It lets you capture the essence of a design at a high level
- It lect you identify risky aspects of a design
- It lets you develop a model incrementally
- It lets you simulate and analyze the model as you go

-->

### Alloy idea

In other words, *before* you start implementing
a system, you can start specifying the entities that make it up,
what constraints (i.e. invariants) hold for them,
and how they hang together.

### What is Alloy?

- A flexible *language* for describing structures (and how they interrelate)
- It can describe both 
  - static structures
  - dynamic behaviours[^temporal]

\pause

- Comes with a tool, the Alloy *Analyzer*
  - Generates counterexamples to theorems/statements

<!--
[src: jackson, alloy-6898.pdf, "a new approach"]
-->

[^temporal]: An Alloy extension, Electrum, exists which is
  well-suited for modelling
  properties of systems over time using temporal logic. However,
  we will restrict ourselves to very simple dynamic behaviours using plain Alloy.

### Alloy advantages

- Small and easy to use
- Has a simple and uniform semantics based on mathematical *relations*
- Can be easily analysed using automated tools


### Comparison with UML

Alloy has some similarities with UML --

- It has a graphical notation
- It is somewhat similar to the *Objects Constraint Language* used by UML[^ocl]

And several differences:

- Unlike UML, Alloy has precise semantics
- It is a far smaller and simpler formalism than UML 
  - UML allows for many constructs (e.g. use cases, state charts) that
    don't have an equivalent in Alloy

### Using Alloy

- The Alloy analyser is distributed as a Java `.jar` file (or a `.dmg` file for
  Mac OS X) -- see the [Alloy 6.0 release page][alloy-6-rel]
  - The `.jar` file can be run like this:

::: code

####

```
    java -jar org.alloytools.alloy.dist.jar 
```

### Using Alloy

\small

I have also set up a GitHub repository which lets you use
the Alloy analyser from within an online IDE using [Gitpod][gitpod] -- \

### Alloy -- sigs

In Alloy, we declare rules about a mini-universe: things that
exist, and properties that should be true of them.

We declare things that exist with `sigs` (short for "signatures"):

-   "There are things called animals"

    `sig Animal {}`

-   "A cat is a sort of animal"

    `sig Cat extends Animal {}`

The two declarations above declare kinds of "things" that exist.

### Alloy -- facts and assertions

We can also write:

- \alert{facts}: These *force* something to be true of our model.
  They act as constraints on it. Alloy won't generate any instances
  of the model in which the facts don't hold.

  - A fact is *part* of our specification.

- \alert{assertions}: An assertion *claims* something is true of our model (but
  it could be wrong).

  - You can think of these as similar to assertions in Dafny or in other languages
  - They're like a debugging tool such as `println` -- they let you *ask*
    whether some fact is true or not.
  - The assertion isn't part of the specification; it's something we use to check
    what consequences flow from our specification.

### Alloy

When modelling entities in Alloy -- we normally include only
the bare minimum of properties needed in order to show how the system
"hangs together".

### Alloy language

\small

-   For example -- we'll look at a simple model of a file system (based on
    the Alloy tutorial at <http://alloytools.org/tutorials/online/>)
-   An Alloy specification looks a little like Java:

::: block

####

\footnotesize

``` { .alloy }
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

### Alloy primitives

- In Alloy, everything is built up from \alert{atoms} and \alert{relations}

- An *atom* in alloy is an indivisible, immutable value
  - We don't create these directly -- they get automatically generated by
    the analyser 
  - Example atoms: `A0`, `A1`, `B0`, `R0` ...

- A *relation* is a structure that relates atoms together --
  - It is a set of \alert{tuples}


### Alloy primitives


The easiest way to think of relations is probably to think of them
as a sort of table -- which show how columns of things are \alert{related}.

e.g. "shares an office with":

| Person A | Person B |
|----------|----------|
| Alice    | Bob      |
| Bob      | Alice    |
| Dan      | Eve      |
| Eve      | Dan      |



Each row is called a *tuple*.

### Alloy relations

In other languages, we might have scalar values (e.g. `int`s, `double`s),
various types of containers (e.g. `array`, `List`), and ways of combining
types together into a `class` (or `struct` in C).

In Alloy, these are all subsumed under *relations*.

We will see that sets, scalars, properties and so on,
are all defined in terms of relations.

### Alloy -- relations

Alloy's semantics are defined in terms of relations.

Example relations:

-   "Is less than". e.g. "$2 < 4$", "$10 < 9$".
-   "Is the blood relative of". e.g. "Alice is the blood relative of
    Bob".
-   "Shares an office with". e.g. "Bob shares an office with Carol".

These are all *binary relations*. Statements about two entities,
which can be true or false.

### Alloy -- relations

Relations can also be *unary* (about one entity):

-   "Is even". e.g. "$even(2)$.
-   "Is an employee". e.g. "Dan is an employee".

### Alloy -- relations

They can be ternary:

-   "\_ is delivered to \_, by \_". e.g. "The *blue book* was delivered to
    *Alice*, by *Bob*".

Or, in general, they can be *n*-ary -- a statement about *n*
things.

### Alloy -- relations

We can think of predicates as being a bit like functions -- an *n*-ary predicate
isn't true or false in itself, until we supply it with *n* arguments.

-   "Is less than" isn't true or false, but "$2 < 4$" is.

### Alloy -- relations

Relations can be finite, or infinite.

An infinite relation: "is less than"

| Number A | Number B |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 2        | 3        |
| ...      | ...      |


### Alloy relations

- *Sets* are unary (1-column) relations. e.g.

  ```
  Name = { N0,
           N1, 
           N2 }
  ```

- *Scalars* are actually 1-element sets:

  ```
  myName = N0
  ```

- Binary or ternary or higher relations are possible:

  ```
  names = { (B0, N0),
            (B0, N1),
            (B1, N2)  }
  ```

### Alloy -- sigs

`sig Animal {}` says "There are things called animals".

It defines a unary relation, "Animal". Something thing can
be-an-animal, or not.

### Alloy -- sigs

`sig Cat extends Animal {}` says "Cats are a sort of animal".

*If* something has the property "is-an-animal", *then* it might
also have the property "is-a-cat".

We can read "extends" as also meaning "is a kind of", or "is a subtype
of".

### Alloy -- subtypes

\footnotesize

-   So, **`extends`** indicates subtypes (similar to Java).
-   Here, **`Dir`** and **`File`** are both subtypes of **`FSObject`**:

    ```java
    sig FSObject {}

    sig Dir extends FSObject {}

    sig File extends FSObject {}
    ```
-   When we declare **`Dir`** or a **`File`** to be sub-types of
    **`FSObject`**, they are considered to be *mutually disjoint* sets
-   The above says "There are things called FSObjects. An FSObject might
    be a Dir or it might be a File,
    but not both".    


### Alloy -- properties

We can specify *properties* of entities:

::: block

####

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

### Alloy -- properties

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

These are usually written within the sig of an entity.

They actually represent *relations* between entities.

### Alloy -- properties

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }
```

:::

There are multiple ways of reading this:

-   "There are such things as FSObjects. An FSObject has
    the property 'parent'. An FSObject can have zero or one
    parents." Or --
-   "A relation 'parent' exists between FSObjects and Dirs.
    Whenever an FSObject appears in the relation, it can be
    association with at most one Dir."

These are exactly equivalent.    

### Alloy -- properties

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }
```

:::

-   The "`lone`" means "zero or one". It is a *cardinality*.
-   Other possible cardinalities are:

    - "some" (one or more)
    - "one" (exactly one)
    - "set" (zero or more)
-   When we specify a property using a colon in this way, the default
    multiplicity is one.
-   We can use cardinalities whenever we are specifying a set or
    relation: since sigs also represent sets (e.g. the set of Dirs),
    we can give them cardinalities, too.

### Alloy -- properties

::: block

####

\small

```java
one sig RootDir extends Dir { }
```

:::


There exists a "RootDir", but only one of them.

###  Exercise

Games:

-   There are things called games.
-   Games can be board games, or field games.
-   There may be other sorts of games.


### Alloy language -- comments

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

> -   Comments can be written in multiple ways
>     -   single-line comments with "`//`" or "`--`"
>     -   multile comments with "`/* ... */`"    


### Alloy -- facts

\footnotesize
              
> -   How can we express that any **`FSObject`** is either a 
>     **`Dir`** or a **`File`**? \
>     (i.e., there are no other sorts of **`FSObject`**)
> -   Alloy also allows us to specify *constraints*. These
>     are introduced with the keyword **`fact`**.
> 
>     ::: block
>
>     ####

>     ```java
>     sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }
>     sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }
>     sig File extends FSObject { }
>     
>     // All file system objects are either files or directories
>     fact { File + Dir = FSObject }
>     ```
>
>     :::

### Alloy -- facts

-   The general syntax for a fact is

    **`fact`** *`name`* { *`formulas`* } 
-   *formulas* are Boolean expressions, and by putting them
    in a fact, we're constraining them to be true.

### Alloy -- abstract signatures

> -   An alternative way to say that all FSObjects must be Dirs or Files
>     would be to declare FSObject **`abstract`**
> -   This is similar to the use of the **`abstract`** keyword in Java; \
>     it means there are no objects that are *directly* of type 
>     FSObject; they must be members of some subtype, instead.


### Alloy -- operators

Operators are available to construct Boolean expressions.

-   subset: **`in`**
    -    *`set1`* **`in`** *`set2`* ---  *`set1`* is a subset of
         *`set2`* \
    -    informally: "some *`set2`* are *`set1`*", or "a *`set2`* may be
         *`set1`*"; \
         but the set-theoretic meaning is more precise.
-   set equality: **`=`**
    -   *`set1`* **`=`** *`set2`* ---  *`set1`* equals *`set2`* 
-   scalar equality: **`=`**     
    -   `scalar` **`=`** *`value`* ---  *`scalar`* equals *`value`* 


###  Alloy -- subsets

-   We saw that subtypes are disjoint.
-   We can also declare sub*sets*:

    **`sig`** *`signame`* **`in`** *`supername`* `{ ... }`
-   Subsets are *not* necessarilly disjoint, and may have
    multiple parents

###  Alloy -- subsets

\footnotesize

::: block

####

```java
sig Animal {}
sig Cat extends Animal {}
sig Dog extends Animal {}
sig FurryPet in Cat + Dog {}
```

:::

-   "`FurryPet`" is a subset of the union of `Cat` and `Dog`.
-   Some dogs and cats may not be furry (hairless breeds).
-   We could *make* them all furry as follows:

::: block

####

```java
fact { Cat + Dog = FurryPet }
```

:::

-   Are there animals other than cats and dogs? \
    Can they be furry?

### More operators

\small

-   We can use Boolean connectives **`and`**, **`or`**, **`implies`**,
    **`iff`**, **`not`**
    to join Boolean expressions.
-   e.g.

::: block

####

```java
fact { A + B = C and X + Y = Z }
```

:::


### Relations


-   In our file-system example, we also saw things in the
    *body* of signatures (i.e., between the braces).

\pause

::: block

####

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

### Relations

\small

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

-   To a first approximation, we can think of relations as behaving like
    *fields* in an OO language.
-   `sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }` can be read as \
    "Things of type `FSObject` *have a parent*, which is of type `Dir`".
-   Recall that **`lone`** means "at most one" -- i.e., you can have zero or one
    parents.\
    (We need this because the root directory has no parent.)

### Relations

::: block

####

\small

```java
// A file system object in the file system
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

// A directory in the file system
sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

// A file in the file system
sig File extends FSObject { }
```

:::

-   More precisely, `parent` is a relation between
    `FSObject` and `Dir`.

###  Relations -- multiplicities

-   **`lone`** is a type of multiplicity -- it says how many
    of something there are.
-   Other multiplicities:
    -   **`one`** - one
    -   **`some`** - at least one; one or more
    -   **`set`**  - zero or more
    -   **`no`**  - zero 
-   The default multiplicity is one.    

###  Relations -- multiplicities

-   In set theory terms ...
-   **`one`** means the relation is a total function -- \
    `sig Student { name : one String }` -- \
    for every Student, we can map to a string which is their name.
-   **`lone`** means the relation is a *partial* function -- \
    `sig Student { driverLicenseNum : lone String }` -- \\
    for every Student, we *may* be able to map to a diver's license
    number. \
    (Here, it's assumed you can't have more than one license.)



### Relations

\small

-   So, signature declarations will look like:

    ~~~
    sig SomeName {
      field1 : FieldType,
      field2a, field2b : OtherFieldType
    }
    ~~~
-   The order of declarations doesn't matter -- `SomeName`, `FieldType`
    and `OtherFieldType` could be declared in any order in a file.

### Relations

::: block

####

\small

```java
  // A directory in the file system
  sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }
```

:::

-   Here, we say that a `Dir` has a field `contents`, which is 
    a *set* of `FSObject`s.
-   The could contain one item, many items, or no items.

###  Examples

\small

-   "A car has one engine"

    `sig Car { engine: one Engine }`, or \
    `sig Car { engine: Engine }`

-   "People have zero or more hobbies"

    `sig Person { hobbies: set Activity }`


###  Exercises

> -   Classes have at least one lecturer, and zero or more students.
> -   Animals have zero or more legs
> -   Some animals are carnivores
> -   Textbooks have one or more pages 

###  Back to the file system example

::: block

####

\small

```java
sig FSObject { parent: lone Dir }

sig Dir extends FSObject { contents: set FSObject }

sig File extends FSObject { }

// There exists a root
one sig Root extends Dir { } { no parent }
```

:::

-   FSObjects have parents, and directories have contents,
    and we have constrained the multiplicities ...
-   but there's currently no connection between them.

###  File system

-   So we could have this situation:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/crazy-fs1.png}
\end{center}

###  File system

\small

-   We will need to constrain things more, so we'll use a *fact*.

    ~~~
    // A directory is the parent of its contents
    fact { all d: Dir, o: d.contents | o.parent = d }
    ~~~

-   This says: "for any thing (let's call it *d* for the moment)
    of type `Dir`, and for any thing (let's call it *o* for the moment)
    which is in the set `d.contents`: \
    *o*'s parent is *d*. 
-   It uses a *quantifier* ("all") -- we'll look at these more later.
