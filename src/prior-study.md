Completion of 12 points of programming-based units is a prerequisite
for enrolling in {{ siteinfo.unitcode }}. In particular, it's assumed that you are
familiar with programming in at least one statically type-checked language
(typically either C or Java). Please let the Unit Coordinator
know as soon as possible if this is not the case.

Advisable prior study for the unit is: 

1. [familiarity with a statically type-checked language (e.g. Java,
C)](#static-lang), and
2. [CITS3301/CITS4401 Software Requirements and Design](#requirements).

## Statically type-checked languages

We assume you are familiar with

- the difference between compile-time and run-time errors
- protections provided by a type system
- the difference between *interface* and *implementation* (abstraction,
  or information hiding)

If not, you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
We provide some starting points here, but it's your responsibility to
ensure you have a good understanding of these concepts.


## Software requirements

We assume you are already familiar with

- what a software requirement is and how to express one
- the difference between functional and non-functional requirements
- what makes for good or bad software requirements

If not, you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
We provide some starting points here, but it's your responsibility to
ensure you have a good understanding of these concepts.

Requirements engineering lecture slides

:   A good source of information is the CITS4401 lecture materials. The current
    content is contained in the University's Blackboard LMS system, but
    you may be able to obtain access to it by contacting the unit
    coordinator for CITS4401.
    The relevant lectures are the ones on *requirements engineering*.

    Other sets of lecture slides you might find helpful include those
    from the University of Michigan course EECS 481 Software
    Engineering, available [here][umich] and archived
    [here][umich-archived]. Particularly relevant slides are the ones
    on *Requirements and Specification* and on
    *Elicitation, Validation and Risk*.

    The Carnegie Mellon University course 17-313 Foundations of Software Engineering
    has useful slides on requirements engineering [here][cmu-slides],
    archived [here][cmu-archived].
    The most relevant slides are the ones on *Requirements
    (Introduction)*, *Requirements (Elicitation and documentation)*, and
    *Requirements (Validation and risk)*.

Requirements engineering online lectures

:   Daniel Mendez of the Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden, has
    an excellent series of video lectures on requirements engineering.

    You can find the full list of lectures on YouTube
    [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1MU5ch0GrUHaS7qwYbGeUjME4m6QZNm).

    Another good series of lecures is by [Grischa Liebel][grischa]. You
    can a playlist of requirements engineering lectures on YouTube
    [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCTWqbu-D5bPpTPZgTjRONyzx38pgZ8bP).
    The relevant lectures are from *Module 1* on *Requirements
    engineering*.
