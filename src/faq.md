## Study practices

### How can I do well in CITS5501? { #how-can-I-do-well-in-CITS5501 }

Some suggestions on [working effectively][work-effectively] in Computer
Science and Software Engineering are available from the
[CSSE teaching website][csse-teaching-server] â€“ you might like to review
those, as well as the UWA Library's [Study support][study-support] page.

The [STUDY*Smarter* pages][study-smarter]
and workshops may be useful to you.
CITS5501 assessments may ask you to *think critically* about testing
and quality assurance, and to *justify a position*, so the Academic
English workshops (such as "Critical thinking & academic culture" and
"Writing justifications") may prove especially useful.

[study-smarter]: https://www.uwa.edu.au/students/Support-services/Academic-support
[work-effectively]: https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/unitinfo?year=2025&opt=Fworkingeffectively
[csse-teaching-server]: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/unitinfo/
[study-support]: https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Help-and-support/Study-support

It's also useful to remember that [active learning][active-learning]
has been demonstrated[^deslauriers] to be a more effective learning approach than
passive learning. Some active learning strategies include:

- linking new knowledge to areas you're already familiar with
- solving problems (for instance, from labs and past exams)
- writing, running and debugging code
- constructing a "[mind map][mind-map]" of unit topics.

A good resource containing more information on these strategies
and others is the University of Melbourne [page on active
learning][active-learning].

[active-learning]: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/studying-effectively/active-learning
[mind-map]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map

[^deslauriers]: For an overview, see for instance: Deslauriers et al,
  "Measuring Actual Learning versus Feeling of Learning in Response to
  Being Actively Engaged in the Classroom." *Proceedings of the National
  Academy of Sciences* 116, no. 39 (September 24, 2019): 19251--19257.
  Available at <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821936116>.

### How much study time will CITS5501 require? { #how-much-study-time }

See the [site welcome page][time-required], under ["Time required"][time-required].

[time-required]: /#time-required

### What are the textbooks and recommended readings for the unit? { #recommended-readings }

See ["Recommended readings"](/schedule/#recommended-readings) on the
[Resources page](/resources). This lists the two textbooks,
outlines the recommended reading for each week, and contains
a link to UWA's "Unit Readings" site.

### Should I buy a copy of the textbooks?

It wouldn't hurt.
The Pressman textbook, in particular, contains useful information
on a very wide range of software engineering topics that will
prove useful not only in this unit, but also
in other units and in your later career.
Cheap second-hand copies of both texts are usually available
from [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com),
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au), or
[Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com).

Online access to the texts and recommended readings
is also available through UWA's "Unit Readings"
site -- see ["Recommended readings"](/schedule/#recommended-readings).

### How can I keep backups of my work? { #backups }

Take a look at the MIT "Missing Semester of Your CS Education"
[page on "Backups"][missing-backups] for good backup strategies to
adopt.

*Local* backup systems are available for all popular operating
systems in use today (e.g. Time Machine for MacOS), but you should
ensure you keep offsite copies of your work as well.

[missing-backups]: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/backups/

Offsite copies of your work can be stored
using UWA's [student network storage][student-network-storage]{ class="hi-pri" },
or alternatively, backup services
can be purchased for less than $5 per month (e.g. from carbonite.com).

[student-network-storage]: https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1570/~/student-network-storage-explained

In [*addition* to keeping backups][is-not-version-control], it's a good idea to keep your work
[under version control](#version-control).

[is-not-version-control]: https://pragmatos.net/2011/09/01/time-machine-is-not-version-control/

### How can I keep my work under version control? { #version-control }

Use [Git][git]. It isn't the
<a class="tooltip"
  href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org"
  target="_blank"
  data-tooltip-text="That would be Mercurial">
easiest</a> version-control system to use,
nor the
<a class="tooltip"
  href="http://darcs.net"
  target="_blank"
  data-tooltip-text="That would be Darcs">
most flexible</a>,
nor the
<a class="tooltip"
  href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/"
  target="_blank"
  data-tooltip-text="That would be Fossil">
most reliable</a> --
nor, really, the best in any way at all, except that it *is* used almost everywhere in the
software development industry, so you might as well get familiar with
it.

You will be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for the project.
GitHub is a very widely used web-based service for hosting Git repositories.
A workshop on the basics of using GitHub  for group-based software development
will be held in the [week 5 lecture](https://cits5501.arranstewart.io/schedule/).

MIT University provides an [introduction to Git][mit-git] and an
explanation of why you should use a version-control system.

[git]: https://git-scm.com
[mit-git]: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/

You might also find the following resources helpful:

- [A Non-Programmer's Introduction to Git](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/14/non-programmer-git-intro/){{blank}}, a blog post by Scott Lowe
- Eric Sink's book/website [*Version Control by Example*](https://ericsink.com/vcbe/index.html){{blank}}, especially
  sections 1 ("Introduction"), 2 ("Basics"), and 8 ("Basics with Git").

### Do I need a laptop in order to complete CITS5501? { #laptops }

You will need a laptop when attending lab classes.

UWA provides [financial support][fin-supp] via the "SOS IT Equipment
Scheme" to students who are unable to purchase a laptop due to financial
hardship, and also provides [short-term loans][laptop-loans] of laptops.

[laptop-loans]: https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/3583/~/short-term-laptop-loans
[fin-supp]: https://www.uwa.edu.au/students/Support-services/Financial-assistance#:~:text=SOS%20IT%20Equipment%20Scheme

-----

## Lectures

### Where can I find the lecture slides?

On the ["Resources" page][slides], under
[**"Lecture slides"**][slides]{ class="hi-pri" }.
They'll be published there progressively throughout the semester.
For previous years' lecture slides, see [here](#previous-content).

[slides]: /resources/#lectures

### Are lectures recorded? { #are-lecturers-recorded }

**The lectures are recorded**{ class="hi-pri" }, and will be
available via the {{ siteinfo.lms }} -- usually within an
hour of the lecture finishing.

But please note that recordings do
sometimes fail -- so if you *can* attend the lecture in person or
online, it's recommended.

### Where can I find the lecture recordings? { #accessing-lecture-recordings }

Sign into the Blackboard {{ siteinfo.lms }}, bring up the "CITS5501"
unit, and click on "Lecture Recordings" on the left-hand sidebar. Then
click on the link marked "Lecture Recording System"; a new page should
launch, taking you to the appropriate part of the [Echo360
system][echo360] where the lecture recordings are stored.

[echo360]: https://echo360.com

### Can I attend lectures online? { #online-lectures }

Short answer: no, only face-to-face attendance is available.

Longer answer: currently, it is the policy of the department of Computer Science and
Software Engineering at UWA that units be offered in
**face-to-face mode only**{ class="hi-pri" }.
This is intended to convey to students that they need to engage and interact
face-to-face for at least some activities for effective learning, and
allows teaching staff to schedule face-to-face assessments such as
invigilated tests. See the UWA page on ["study modes"][study-modes] for
more information.

The department continues to support students with many flexible study
options, however, such as [recorded lectures](#are-lecturers-recorded)
and [online submission](#assessment-submission) of assessments.


[study-modes]: https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1568/~/study-modes-explained

In the event of Covid 19 restrictions, lectures and labs will be
conducted completely online (accessible via MS Teams), and any student
oral presentations will be done via MS Teams.

------

## Labs

### Where can I find lab worksheets?

On the ["Resources" page][worksheets], under
[**"Worksheets"**][worksheets]{ class="hi-pri" }.
They'll be published there progressively throughout the semester.
For previous years' worksheets, see [here](#previous-content).

[worksheets]: /resources/#worksheets

### What's contained in the lab worksheets?

The lab worksheets contain practical exercises to reinforce concepts
covered in lectures, as well as occasional links to Moodle self-paced
quizzes, or problems for you to attempt in-class.
Some worksheets may include optional "challenge" exercises or problems for students
seeking additional challenges -- these are not compulsory, but are
provided for your interest.

### Are solutions to lab problems published?

Any solutions to problems in a lab worksheet will normally be published the following week,
to allow students time to work through lab problems independently.
Solutions to any "challenge" problems are typically not published, but you are welcome to
discuss your solutions with the lab facilitators or the unit coordinator if you have
attempted them.

### Is attendance recorded for labs?

No -- if you don't want to attend the labs, you do not have to. However,
the labs provide the best opportunity for getting feedback and
assistance from teaching staff, as a lab [facilitator](/#facilitators)
is available at each lab. It's therefore strongly recommended that you do attend.


### Can I attend lab sessions other than the one I'm allocated to? { #attending-labs }

Yes -- as long as there is room available for you, you are welcome to attend other
lab sessions. See [under "labs"][labs], on the site home page, for details.

[labs]: /#labs


----

## Timetable

### Where can I find the unit timetable?

You should have a personal timetable available through
CAS (UWA's Class Allocation System). But you can
also get full details of lecture and lab times and venues by
visiting UWA's **[Timetable site][timetable-site]{{blank}}**{ class="hi-pri" }.
(If the information for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }} is not visible, then enter "{{ siteinfo.unitcode }}" in the
box labelled "Unit search", and then click "Show timetable".)

[timetable-site]: https://timetable.applications.uwa.edu.au/?selectunits={{ siteinfo.unitcode }}

-----


## Assessments

### Do any of the assessments require (or permit) group work?

Yes -- the project is a group project. All other assessments are to be completed individually.
See also [Academic conduct and source citation](#academic-conduct-source-citation).

### How do I submit an assessment? { #assessment-submission }

Details of how to submit each assessment will be released on
the [Assessment page](/assessment/).
Most of the assessments will be submitted using [Moodle]({{moodle_url}}){{blank}}.
In order to submit an assessment, you'll need to create an account on
the Moodle server by visiting the [Moodle signup page][moodle-signup].
You'll need to use your UWA email address, select a username (usually,
your given name), select a password, and provide your first and last
name. (All other details are optional.)

[moodle-signup]: https://quiz.jinhong.org/login/signup.php

### How do I register as a participant on Moodle? { #moodle-registration }

Visit <https://quiz.jinhong.org> and sign up
using your UWA email address.

You should register on Moodle as early as possible so that your Moodle user ID properly reflects the project group you are in, and well before the week of the [first assessment](/assessment/).


### What is the marking rubric for the assessment items? { #marking-rubric }

Marking rubrics for an assessment item will normally be published with
that assessment item. In particular, the unit project will have a
breakdown of marks available, and how they can be achieved.

Wherever possible, we adopt a rubric based on the following scheme:

**Multiple choice/multiple selection/numeric answer/short answer question**{ class="hi-pri" }

:   These will normally be worth only a small amount each (e.g. 1 or 2
    marks out of a 50-mark quiz or test), and are typically
    marked automatically.
    100% is awarded for a correct answer, and 0% for an incorrect
    answer.

    Make sure to read these questions **carefully**, and answer **exactly** as
    requested. (E.g., if an answer asks for "Only a number", then
    answering "20 bytes", for example, would be marked incorrect.)
    Misreading the instructions will not be grounds for
    appealing an assessment decision.

    If answering a multiple choice or multiple selection question, you
    should give the best answer of those offered â€“ if you think multiple
    answers are correct, but only one is allowed, give the one that's
    most correct. (Or, if you think none are correct, give the one that's
    least incorrect.)

    If a question is ambiguous, you may make reasonable assumptions in
    order to answer it. (If the assessment item provides space to record
    your assumptions, then make sure to write them down -- make sure you
    paste in the **full question text** your assumption relates to, as
    not all students get the questions in the same order -- and give each
    question a clear, bolded heading.)

    You can assume that the answer to any short answer question is
    *never* more than 5 words long (and most will be only two or three
    words long). You must always give a *single* answer -- responses
    which try to "hedge" and give multiple alternatives ("this ***or***
    that") will be marked incorrect.


**"Long answer" questions requiring code**{ class="hi-pri" }

:   These will typically be (partly or wholly) automatically marked.

    Unless specified otherwise:

    <div class="medium-list">

    - answers should be self-contained, and import any necessary
      packages
    - code should be clearly written, well-formatted, and easy for others
      to understand
    - function or method bodies should contain [only such inline comments
      as are necessary for a reader to understand the code][no-inline]; excessive
      inline comments will result in low marks for code clarity and style
    - functions or methods should be documented using [documentation
      blocks][docblocks] (see [here][lsst-doc] and [here][cmu-doc]
      for guidelines)
    - code should compile without errors or warnings
    - code should follow sound programming practices, including:
      - the use of meaningful comments
      - well chosen identifier names
      - appropriate choice of basic data-structures, data-types, and functions
      - appropriate choice of control-flow constructs
      - proper error-checking of any library functions called, and
      - cleaning up/closing any files or resources used.
    - unless specifically required to, functions or methods should never print to
      standard output. Besides
      being poor practice, unnecessary printing to standard
      output can interfere with the testing of your code; if it does, that will
      result in 0 marks being awarded for functionality.


    </div>

[cmu-doc]: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/doc/doxygen.html

**"Long answer" questions requiring an answer in English:**{ class="hi-pri" }

:   These will typically present a fact-based scenario, and require you
    to answer a question or make a recommendation.
    The aim of these questions is for you to demonstrate that you can:

    - distinguish the relevant from irrelevant facts in the problem description
    - identify what topics we have covered which apply in this case, and how
    - come up with a clear recommendation or answer
    - justify that recommendation (logically, or via evidence covered in
      classes).

    "Identifying relevant facts/topics" and "justifying answers
    appropriately" are the key things we are looking for in answers to
    these questions. If an answer is provided with **no** justification,
    it will be awarded 0 (even if otherwise correct), as it does not
    satisfy the criteria for an acceptable answer.

    When answering such questions, you **should**{ class="hi-pri" }:

    - Make sure your answer is **comprehensible**{ class="hi-pri" }. If
      we can't understand your answer, we can't give you credit!
    - Try to keep your answer **concise**{ class="hi-pri" }. But value
      comprehensibility over concision.
    - Make sure your answers are **self-contained**{ class="hi-pri" },
      and do not refer to your answers to other questions. Different
      questions may be marked by different people!
    - Make sure you answer the question **fully**{ class="hi-pri" }. If you only answer
      part of the question (or do not at all answer the question asked),
      you cannot be awarded full marks (no matter how relevant the facts
      you discuss or how good a justification you provide).
      If you only answer part of a question, you may receive
      a proportion of the marks for that question.

    For each such question:

    - 50% of the marks are awarded for correctly identifying the
      relevant facts or topics or principles to apply, and not
      discussing irrelevant facts/topics/principles.
    - 50% of the marks are awarded for appropriately justifying your answers

    Guidance as to how the "relevance" and "justification" components
    are assessed is given in the following table. A *proficient* answer
    will be awarded 70â€“100% of the marks for that component; a
    *satisfactory* answer will be awarded 50â€“69% of the mark for that
    component; and a *not yet satisfactory* answer will be awarded 0â€“49%
    of the mark for that component.

    ![]({{ '/images/rubric-table.png'  | url }})


### What should I do if a question or task in an assessment is ambiguous or contains an error? { #errors-in-questions }

For **projects**{ class="hi-pri" }:

: You will need to clarify the meaning of the question or task
  in the unit [Help forum]({{ forum_url }}) before submitting the assessment.
  Before making a new post in the Help forum, do a search
  to see if someone else has asked the same question already
  and received an answer.

For **"long answer"**{ class="hi-pri" } questions in **quizzes, tests or exams**{ class="hi-pri" }:

: If the question is ambiguous, or you believe it contains an error or
  requires you to make assumptions in order to answer it, then you may
  make whatever reasonable assumptions are required in order to answer it.

  Ensure you document these assumptions in your answer.

For **"short answer"**{ class="hi-pri" } questions in **quizzes, tests or exams**{ class="hi-pri" }:

: You **should**{ class="hi-pri" } answer to the best of your ability,
  bearing in mind the [rubric](#marking-rubric) and guidelines for
  short-answer questions. You may be assured that you will not be
  disadvantaged if there is an error in the question.

  Tests will include a zero-mark question at the end where
  you can include
  questions or comments about the test and can alert the unit
  coordinator to any perceived errors.
  If a question is ambiguous, you may make reasonable assumptions in
  order to answer it, and should record your assumptions in the answer
  to this zero-mark question.
  If applicable, your comments may be considered when marking.

  If you need to put a question or comment in this zero-mark question,
  make sure you paste in the **full question text** it relates to (as
  not all students get the questions in the same order) and make
  sure you give each
  question a clear, bolded heading.

  You **may not**{ class="hi-pri" } contact the unit coordinator
  (or any other person) regarding the content of questions while a test
  is running -- see ["Test conduct"](#test-conduct).

### I have a UniAccess accommodation plan, do I need to let you know about this? { #accommodations }

Yes.

Your UniAccess accommodation plan (UAAP) will state that if you have alternative
exam arrangements for a quiz, test, exam or other timed assessment, then
you need to contact the Unit Coordinator at least 2-3 weeks prior to the
date of the assessment to request that these arrangements be put in
place. Please do so by [emailing the Unit Coordinator](/#unit-coordinator).

If your UniAccess accommodation plan states that you require flexibility
with submission deadlines, then it will also state that you should
"contact the Unit Coordinator in a timely manner, i.e. no later than
three university working days after the due date". It will be greatly
appreciated if you can alert the Unit Coordinator as early as possible
that you'll be submitting late, but staff understand that this is not
always feasible. Note that adjustments to submission deadlines do not
apply to quizzes, tests or exams for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }}.

## Group assessment

### Are project groups self-selected or allocated? Why?

Students will be **allocated** to a group of (approx.) 5 students for the project.
Each group is assigned a lab facilitator who will meet with the group fortnightly to support team forming and project matters, and
who will mark the project and moderate the team professional contribution mark.
The group list will be published in the CITS5501/3501 MS Teams area and announced in the discussion forum.

See the [Project Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aec632d098f164f5a8fefc272e14ae398%40thread.tacv2/Project%20Teams?groupId=daaeb288-ca0c-4b3f-824b-60462e4a2e3d&tenantId=05894af0-cb28-46d8-8716-74cdb46e2226) link in MS Teams for more resources on getting the most out of team work.

Project groups are randomly allocated. This method simulates real-world working
environments where you'll often collaborate with colleagues and clients you haven't chosen.
Random allocation also promotes fairness by ensuring that students who might struggle to form a group independently are included.
Our aim is to foster diverse and inclusive teams, as working with diverse perspectives tends
to lead to more nuanced understanding of the unit material.

<!--
{#

on group assessment, see
<https://teaching.cornell.edu/teaching-resources/active-collaborative-learning/collaborative-learning/how-evaluate-group-work>

#}
-->

When students choose their own groups, they often select friends or close acquaintances.
While this can create a [comfortable working environment][groupthink],
learning to communicate effectively with different working styles is crucial in real-world
teams,
and research shows that personal growth is best fostered when students go [outside their comfort zone][comfort].

<!--
{#
comment:
also - some evidence suggests students have more creative ideas
when groups _don't_ self-select.

[comfort]: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/03/leaving-your-comfort-zone-inspires-motivation-growth


### My team and I are unable to find a time when we can all meet â€“ what can we do?

Groups are allocated based on the lab session you selected in CAS.  Groups can meet online or face to face, although at least some face to face meetings should be arranged.   Any problems with group attendance should be raised in the first instance with your assigned facilitator, or with the unit coordinator by making an Office Hours appointment or by emailing <cits5501-pmc@uwa.edu.au>.


<!--
{#
comment: NO SWAPS
If your team is struggling to find a suitable meeting time, there is an opportunity to swap
team members during the first two weeks after groups are announced (and before the project
specification is released). You can post on the
forum explaining your reason for wanting to swap, or, if your reasons are more personal and
should remain private, you can contact the Unit Coordinator directly.
Normally, swaps must be agreed upon by all parties involved.
#}
-->

### Is individual contribution taken into account?

Yes, individual contributions are taken into account. Students are asked to quantify the
contributions made by each team member, including themselves. A Contribution Factor (ranging
from 0.0 to 1.2) is calculated based on these assessments and is used to adjust the final
project grade accordingly (with a maximum possible final grade of 100%).
It is highly recommended that students keep a spreadsheet (updated weekly) tracking each
member's allocated tasks and contributions, and/or use a private GitHub repository to track version control.
While these records are not submitted with the project, the Unit Coordinator may request to see
them if any discrepancies arise during the grading process.

In the project, your facilitator meetings will be used for formative discussions and evaluation of professional behaviour
to help you get the best out of group work.


### What are the rules for late submissions and special considerations for the group project? { #late-project }

Groups must submit the project deliverables by their due date.  Penalties will be applied to late submissions according to UWA policy.
UWA's assessment policy states that 
"In cases where a student who is part of a group assessment receives approval for an EVA application, the outcome must be considered in consultation with the Unit Coordinator."
For this project, in accordance with UWA's assessment policy, the 
unit coordinator will "provide an alternative assessment for the individual student" if required; and 
mark to "a reduced assessment task for the group".
Any questions about EVA or UAAPs can be discussed with the unit coordinator at consultation times or email to {% email_el_spannized coordinator.email %}.

<!--
COMMENT: Note that UWA's sem 2 2025 EAV policy DOES allow extensions for group submissions at the discretion of the UC

5.6	In cases where a student who is part of a group assessment receives approval for an EVA application, the outcome must be considered in consultation with the Unit Coordinator. The possible outcomes include:
(a)	extension to an assessment deadline for the whole group;
(b)	provision of alternative assessment for the individual student; and 
i.	redistribution of the assigned work to the rest of the group members with the possibility of an extension to the assessment deadline; and/or
ii.	a reduced assessment task for the group
(c)	Reassignment of group mark to other assessments if assessment task/item is weighted 10 per cent or less. This may be relevant for in-class group activities such as group presentations.
(d)	Where a group member has a UAAP in place, any approved adjustment may be extended to the whole group within reason at the discretion of the UC.
-->

## Academic conduct and source citation { #academic-conduct-source-citation }

### Are assessment submissions checked for plagiarism? { #plagiarism-checks }

Yes, they are.
Your submitted work or answers for any assessment item
may be submitted to plagiarism detectors
such as `JPlag`, `moss` or `turnitin` to detect plagiarism.

Additionally, statistical anomalies in the results for an assessment may
be investigated, and any student may be asked to (orally)
**explain their thought process**{ class="hi-pri" } in coming up with their
answers.


### What are the expectations regarding citation of sources/academic conduct? { #source-citation-conduct-expectations }

You must act in accordance with
UWA's [academic conduct policy][acad-policy].
See the STUDYSmarter team's [Guide to Avoiding Academic
Misconduct][misconduct-guide]{{blank}} (PDF) for additional details.

In particular, you must not plagiarise any
work. Plagiarism is the unattributed use of
someone else's words, creations, ideas or
arguments as one's own. At UWA, it is extended to include paraphrasing
which is too close to the original.

For all assessments -- even those that are "open book" -- you are expected to:

a.  demonstrate an **understanding**{ class="hi-pri" } of the answers
    you write (and you may be asked to later demonstrate that understanding
    in an oral interview); and
b.  ensure any answers you write are **in your own words**{ class="hi-pri" }.

You will only occasionally need to cite sources in this unit, but if you
do, you need to make sure that you

c.  properly **cite**{ class="hi-pri" } any sources you make use of
d.  ensure your source is **reliable**{ class="hi-pri" } (see ["evaluating sources"](#evaluating-sources)),
    and
e.  provide full **bibliographic details**{ class="hi-pri" } for each source
    cited (usually in a "References" section within your answer).

See also ["What referencing/citation style should I use?"](#citation-style).

(For \(c\), note that you need not cite lecture slides or
worksheets provided for this unit as being a source of ideas.
Your answer must still be in your own words, and you may not reproduce the
content of them directly -- copying and pasting in the text of a slide from the
lecture slides as one of your answers
is still plagiarism -- but you need not cite them as a source
of ideas.
It's assumed they are a common source of ideas for all answers.)

The penalties for misconduct in an exam are *very* severe. So don't do
it.

[misconduct-guide]: https://www.uwa.edu.au/students/-/media/project/uwa/uwa/students/docs/studysmarter/r3-avoiding-academic-misconduct.pdf

### What referencing/citation style should I use? { #citation-style }

If scholarly references are included in submitted work, then students
may use any standard citation style they wish (e.g. Harvard, APA, MLA,
IEEE), as long as it is applied consistently. One recommended style
is the "AMS short alpha-numeric" style (see the [AMS style
guide][ams-style-guide]{{blank}} (PDF), sec 10.3).

## Can I use ChatGPT, or other AI tools, when completing an assessment? { #AI-tools }

AI tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT can generate test cases and other code automatically given simple prompts.
Using AI tools effectively for coding tasks will be an important **part of your professional toolkit** as a software developer.
In CITS5501/3501 we will help you learn how to use AI tools effectively for such tasks.
However, AI tools do make mistakes, particularly since they may generate code with limited knowledge of its context.
Therefore, a critical skill for graduates is the **ability to evaluate and critique code generated by AI tools**.
Designing software tests on your own (independently of AI tools) is an important way for you to learn to do this.

UWA's general guidance for the use of AI tools in assessment is that
you are not permitted to use AI tools to complete an assessment, unless the assessment specifically provides for that. Here is a
[description of the University's policy][ai-policy] on the use of AI tools:

[ai-policy]: https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/3432/~/using-chatgpt-and-other-ai-tools-in-your-assessments

> [T]hese tools must not be used as a replacement of your critical thinking and
> analysis skills. AI tools may only be used in an assessment where it is explicitly
> permitted by your Unit Coordinator. Where it is permitted by your Unit Coordinator to use
> AI, you must always cite and reference your uses of it. You cannot submit for assessment
> any work that is not your own.

### Unit coordinator permissions for AI tools in CITS5501/3501 assessments { #AI-tools-in-cits5501 }

For CITS5501/CITS3501 learning activities the following Unit Coordinator permissions apply for the use of AI tools:

- **Online tests:** You **may not use AI tools** in the tests.  Using AI tools in a test or project is depriving yourself of the opportunity to get honest feedback on your own competencies and abilities. In the final exam for the unit, you will not have access to AI tools, so you will have to know how to write code or English answers yourself.  Using AI tools for previous assessments may result in your having a lack of practice at doing so.
- **Group Project:** You **may use AI tools** to generate **up to 25%** of the code for your project.   You **must include a human evaluation** (code review and tests) for any AI-generated code you use.  AI-generated code must also be **acknowledged with an in-code comment**.   Note that almost all of the marks in the project are for your ability to design and evaluate of software quality rather than
generate code (AI generated or not).
- **Labs:** You are strongly recommended to try to do the lab exercises **without AI-assistance**. Sitting with a problem that you can't solve immediately is a very important step for learning. Use your lecture notes, work with a partner, walk through the problem with your facilitator. You **may use AI tools** to check or explain your answers later.
- **Self-study:** You **are encouraged to use AI tools** to help you review and study Software Testing and Quality Assurance topics.
See [Sydney AI for Learners](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/51655) for some excellent resources on learning with AI.
- **Exam:**  Paper-based written exam.  **No AI tools are permitted**.  See the [Assessment](/assessment) page for more details.

### Wouldn't the use of ChatGPT or similar AI tools help ensure the accuracy of code or English answers?

No, it would not. It's true that students sometimes mistakenly think that using ChatGPT or
similar AI tools can help "ensure accuracy" in their code or English answers. But that idea
is mistaken: large language models (LLMs), the class of tools ChatGPT belongs to, do not
have any ability to distinguish correct from incorrect facts, and their sole guide to what
sort of answers they produce is statistical likelihood of particular words appearing. LLM
tools canÂ frequentlyÂ [hallucinate][hallucination]Â incorrect answers, and, due to their
design, are incapable of dealing with certain sorts of questions.

## Tests, quizzes and exams { #tests-quizzes-and-exams }

### What topics are examinable in a quiz, test or exam? { #examinable-material }

For any test, quiz or exam, you may assume that the following are
examinable:

- the contents of the lecture slides
- the spoken content of the lectures
- any recommended reading for the lecture
- any reading linked to from the lecture slides
- the published lab sheets and any unassessed Moodle exercises
- any recommended reading for the labs
- material contained in the solutions or model answers
  for lab worksheets or assessments
- applying any technique covered in the previous items
- any information that can reasonably be deduced
  from the previous items

for all weeks up to and including the week prior to the test, quiz or
exam. That said, the lab exercises are usually a good guide to the
sort of questions that may be asked.


### What happens if I submit a test, quiz or exam late? { #late-submissions }

Online quizzes, tests and exams **must**{ class="hi-pri" } be submitted by the
due date and time -- this will be enforced strictly (just as it is for
face-to-face tests and exams), and late submissions will receive a mark
of 0. It is your responsibility to ensure you submit by the due date and
time -- even if you think a website such as Moodle or the Blackboard LMS might
permit you to make a late submission.

### What if I think there's a mistake in a test, quiz or exam question? { #test-errors }

You **should**{ class="hi-pri" } answer to the best of your ability, and
record any assumptions made: see ["Errors in
questions"](#errors-in-questions).

You **may not**{ class="hi-pri" } contact the unit coordinator
(or any other person)
regarding the content of questions while a test
is running -- see ["Test conduct"](#test-conduct).

### Are the quizzes/tests/exams open book? (Test conduct) { #test-conduct }

Unless specified otherwise, all quizzes (but **not** the final
exam) are "take-home"
and open-book. You **may**{ class="hi-pri" } ***look at***{ class="hi-pri" }
any book,
website or software you like, but the answers must be
**your own work**{ class="hi-pri" } (not
that of anyone else)
and in **your own words**{ class="hi-pri" },
and you must not distribute the questions or your
answers to any other person.

The quizzes and tests are not invigilated but â€“ as with all open assessments â€“ any
statistical anomalies will be investigated, and anybody may be asked
to (orally)
**explain their thought process**{ class="hi-pri" } in coming up with their
answers.

The **exam is *not* open-book**{ class="hi-pri" }, and is invigilated, but you are permitted
access to some materials -- refer to the [Assessment
page][ass-exam]{ class="hi-pri" } for more details.

[ass-exam]: /assessment#exam

**Checking your answers**{ class="hi-pri" }

:   You **should**{ class="hi-pri" }:

    - check your answers for spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors
      before submitting
    - where relevant, feel free to check your answers by writing and
      compiling code
    - consult appropriate reference sites for whatever languages or
      libraries you are using


**Contacting other people**{ class="hi-pri" } { #contacting-other-people }

:   You **may**{ class="hi-pri" } contact the
    [unit coordinator](/#unit-coordinator) if you
    are unable to access the quiz/test/exam or have difficulties submitting
    it. Make sure to include a screenshot of the problem.

    However, other than that, **you may not**{ class="hi-pri" } contact
    any other person (student, staffmember or anyone else) during the
    test.

    If you have a
    question or comment about the test, or would like to alert the unit
    coordinator to a perceived error, include a comment in your working,
    if appropriate, to indicate how you interpreted the question. If
    applicable, your comments may be considered when marking. No
    action can be taken during the test. You are advised to answer to
    the best of your ability and are assured that you will not be
    disadvantaged if there is an error on the question paper. [Source:
    UWA rules for online exams]
    See also, ["Errors in questions"](#errors-in-questions).

### Can I access previous online tests while completing a test? { #previous-test-access }

No, we generally will remove access to previous online tests while a test is in progress.
If you want to make use of feedback you were given on a previous test, you should compile
your own notes incorporating this feedback.

### If I obtain Moodle feedback on a code question multiple times, will I be penalized? { #moodle-penalties }

In an assessed quiz, test or exam, there is no penalty for requesting feedback (via the
"check" button in Moodle) as many times as you like. This is part of the University's
assessment policy.

*Unassessed* quizzes and exercises may behave differently â€“ their aim is to help you gauge
how well you understood concepts and techniques at the time you started the quiz, and might
reduce marks awarded for a question if you need to check or submit it multiple times.

### What if a network infrastructure outage occurs during a test? { #test-outages }

If severe problems occur with the University network infrastructure
or the [Moodle]({{moodle_url}}){{blank}} server occur during a timed quiz, test or
exam, the Unit Coordinator may, at their discretion, permit students
affected by the outage to re-sit the assessment.

Students affected by such an outage should immediately

- take a screenshot showing the issue, if possible
- log the problem with [University IT](https://www.it.uwa.edu.au/it-help/local-support)
- email the [unit coordinator](/#unit-coordinator)

However, this only applies to infrastructure maintained by the
University. If you choose to complete a test at home, it's your
responsibility to ensure you have a reliable computer system and network
connection in order to complete the assessment.

### Can I find out what marks I achieved for a test question? { #test-marks-breakdown }

Yes -- tests are done through [Moodle]({{moodle_url}}){{blank}}, and once marks for the test
are released, you should be able to log in to Moodle and view, for each question, the marks
received, the correct answer, and (for most questions) a short explanation of the answer.
The answer explanation may refer you to content from the lectures, labs, or the recommended
readings.
For questions requiring you to write a long English answer or to submit code, you may also
receive individual feedback from the marker.


### How can I seek clarification on the marks I achieved for a test question? { #test-marks-query }

You should email the [unit coordinator](/#unit-coordinator). Before emailing, make sure you:

- Carefully read through the [marking rubric](#marking-rubric) and any [feedback and
  explanation](#test-marks-breakdown) relating to a question. Often, these will answer
  questions you may have about why a particular answer was considered correct or incorrect.
- Include a subject line which states what unit and what assessment your email relates to.
- Include the full text of the question, the answer you submitted, and the correct answer -- this
  assists teaching staff in responding to your email.\
  (Multiple choice and short answer questions are selected randomly, so if you give only a
  question number, it won't be immediately obvious to a recipient which question you are
  referring to.)
- Explain where you have already looked (usually, the [rubric](#marking-rubric), the
  [answer explanation](#test-marks-breakdown), and any relevant lecture and lab content) and
  why those weren't of assistance.

## Projects

### Late project submissions

Please see
[What are the rules for Late Submissions and Special Considerations for the Group Project?](#late-project)


### Complex computing problems

CITS5501 and CITS3501 are  defined as **advanced units** for the Australian Computer Society (ACS) Accreditation of 
the Master of IT and Bachelor of Engineering (Software Systems) programs.
One of the criteria for advanced units, is that the unit includes project work that assesses
**Complex Computing Criteria** as defined by the international 
[Seoul Accord](https://www.seoulaccord.org/document.php?id=79) agreement for professional computing degrees.
You should keep these requirements in mind when completing the project, and more generally for your studies in this unit.
The criteria for complex computing are:

1. involves wide-ranging or conflicting technical, computing, and other issues; 
2. has no obvious solution, and requires conceptual thinking and innovative analysis to formulate suitable abstract models; 
3. a solution requires the use of in-depth computing or domain knowledge and an analytical approach that is based on well-founded principles; 
4.  involves infrequently encountered issues; 
5. is outside problems encompassed by standards and standard practice for professional computing;
6. involves diverse groups of stakeholders with widely varying needs; 
7. has significant consequences in a range of contexts; 
8. is a high-level problem possibly including many component parts or sub-problems; 
9. identification of a requirement or the cause of a problem is ill defined or unknown. 

### How are problems with the project specification resolved?

An initial specification for the unit project will be published via this
website, and an announcement of this made on the {{helpforum}} discussion
forum.

Students should aim to read through the specification as early as
possible, and clarify any ambiguities, apparent contradictions, or
missing information by posting in the {{helpforum}} discussion
forum.

After initial clarifications have been made -- usually after about a week -- a revised
specification will be released, consolidating any changes or answers
made by the unit coordinator in the {{helpforum}} discussion
forum.

After a revised specification has been published:

<div class="loose-list">

- If there is anything in the specification that appears to be contradictory,
  ambiguous, or under-determined, then students should post to the
  {{helpforum}} forum to clarify their interpretation of the
  specification.<span class="br"></span>
  The unit coordinator may clarify the specification further, or they may decide
  that the specification is now sufficiently clear, and that it's up to
  each student to interpret the specification according to their best judgment
  and ability.
- Unless serious problems with the specification are identified, no further
  revision of the specification will be published -- students should instead
  make sure to check the {{helpforum}} forum for subsequent corrections or
  clarifications (if any).

</div>

If, at the time of project submission, anything in the project specification is
contradictory, ambiguous, or under-determined,
and no student has requested clarification in the forum,
then the unit coordinator may interpret those portions of the specification
in any way they wish (as long as it does not conflict with the remainder of
the specification), and mark submissions accordingly.



### What are the formatting expectations for project reports? { #project-formatting }

The unit project may contain a written English component.
The project specification will explain how this is to be submitted.
Usually, the written component will be submitted as either:

- a PDF (or at your option, a [Markdown][markdown] file), or
- a text input field, available on {{ siteinfo.moodle }}

[markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown

Formatting expectations for these are as follows:

**PDF reports**

: - Your PDF report should use A4 size pages.
  - The font for body text should be between 9 and 12 points.
  - Do not double-space lines.
  - The report should contain numbered headings, with informative
    heading titles.
  - Each question should be answered on a new page.
  - Any diagrams, charts or tables used must be legible and large enough
    to be easily read when viewed on-screen at 100% magnification.
  - All pages (except the cover, if you have one) should be
    numbered.
  - Cover sheets, diagrams, charts, tables, bibliographies and
    reference lists do not count towards any page-count maximums.
  - You are not required to include a cover sheet.

**Markdown file**

: As an alternative to submitting a PDF, you may submit your
  report in neatly formatted
  (max. 72 characters per line) Markdown, and we will either read
  it directly or generate a report from it. In that case:

  - It should either adhere to the [CommonMark spec][commonmark]
    or be [Pandoc-compliant][pandoc] Markdown
  - It should be easily readable as plain text, and contain no
    diagrams, charts or raw LaTeX
  - If present, a bibliography should appear as a plain bulleted list
    at the end of the report (do not use citation keys (`@`),
    BibTex, or similar features). "AMS short alpha-numeric" would
    be a good citation style -- see
    the [AMS style guide][ams-style-guide]{{blank}} (PDF), sec 10.3.

**Text input field**

: The input field should have instructions regarding
  appropriate format.

## Exams

### Are past exams available? { #past-exams-availability }

Yes -- see the [Assessment](/assessment/) page for more details.

[past-papers]: /assessment/#past-exam-papers



-----

## Unit content

### Can I see previous years' content? { #previous-content }

The unit website is archived periodically
by the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) at
<http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cits5501.github.io/>.
You can use the Wayback Machine interface to view previous versions
of the lectures and labs.

The source code for this website is also versioned on GitHub
at <https://github.com/{{ siteinfo.repository }}/>, so you can use
GitHub's interface to look through older versions of the material as
well. The directories you want are probably `assets/lectures` and
`assets/workshops`.

Note that the content of the unit does change slightly from year to
year, so previous years' content will not be a perfect guide to what is
covered in the current year.

### Why is the unit content on GitHub and Moodle? Why not use UWA's Blackboard LMS? { #why-moodle }

Because Blackboard is a very terrible LMS.[^lms-sucks]

[^lms-sucks]: See "[Why Is Your School's LMS So Bad?][lms-so-bad]{{blank}}".

In addition

- Blackboard LMS doesn't allow for (complete or partial) automatic
  marking of coding-based questions, but Moodle does.
- Blackboard LMS content is only available to enrolled students.
  By publishing the unit content as a website,
  I can make potentially useful content available even to someone not
  enrolled in the unit.

[lms-so-bad]: https://www.pathwright.com/blog/why-is-your-schools-lms-so-bad

------

## Discussion forum { #help-forum }

### Can I post questions about the unit content to the discussion forum? { #posting-questions }

Please do! But before posting, you might want to

a.  search the forum (and this page) to see if
    an answer to your question has already been posted, and
b.  review the page ["How do I ask a good question?"][good-question]

[good-question]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

Note that any posts on the discussion forum need to comply with UWA's
[Code of Conduct](/#expectations) and
[academic conduct policy][acad-policy]. That means you should

- endeavour to treat everyone with respect and courtesy and without
  harassment, and
- not post your solutions to an assessment (as this can breach the
  policy against collusion).

<!--

### How do I subscribe to posts from the discussion forum? { #forum-subscriptions }

You can set up an email subscription to the discussion forum
as follows:

1.  Ensure you're logged in to {{help5501}}.
2.  Under the left-hand menu ("{{help_forum}}"), select "edit
    preferences".
3.  Select "yes" to one (or both) of the options
    "email me a copy of every new article immediately" and
    "email me a daily digest of new articles".
4.  Click "Save these preferences".

You should now receive regular updates by email when new posts are
made on the forum.
