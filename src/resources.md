## Lecture slides

Lecture slides will be published here progressively throughout
the semester. (It's also possible to access
[previous years' content](/faq/#previous-content) if you'd
like to get an idea in advance of what will be covered.)

{#
  NBB: there must be **NO BLANK LINEs** between list items here -- else
       ugly extra para elements will appear

 
 if you have commented out text mid-list, you probably want to use

  <hyphen><end-comment> to strip out whitespace after

  i.e. -# but with a brace at the end.
