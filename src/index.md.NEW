## Weekly activities

*(Note that there are no labs in week 1, beginning {{ siteinfo.semesterStartDate | dateWithDay }};
labs don't start until week 2)*{ class="hi-pri" }

**Lecture** { #lecture }

:   There is one two-hour lecture each week
    (starting in week ***one***{ class="hi-pri" }), at
    {{ siteinfo.lecture_time }} in {{ siteinfo.lecture_venue }}.

    I strongly recommend you attend lectures in person -- they
    provide the best forum for asking questions
    about the unit content and clarifying your understanding.
    Lectures are recorded, so if you cannot attend, you can also watch the recorded lecture
    ([accessible via](/faq/#accessing-lecture-recordings)
    the UWA Blackboard {{ siteinfo.lms }}).

    Lecture slides are published [here](/resources/#lectures) on this website.

**Labs**  { #labs }

:   Lab worksheets are published on the [resources page](/resources/#lectures) on this
    website, and there will be a worksheet available for each week from week 2 through
    to week 11. (Week 12 is reserved for your personal revision; no lab worksheet is
    published that week.)

    You should attempt all exercises and activities in the worksheets; you can work through them
    from home or on campus in your own time. Some weeks, the activities will include
    unassessed quizzes or lessons on the CSSE department's [Moodle]({{moodle_url}}){{blank}}
    server. You should ensure you complete these, as they do form part of the
    [examinable material](/faq/#examinable-material).

    Timetabled lab sessions are run on a *drop-in* basis. This means that:

    - Once a worksheet for the lab has been released, you can work through it at your own pace, either at home or on campus.
    - If you run into difficulties or have questions, you are welcome to visit *any*
      timetabled lab session to get them resolved – you do not need to be allocated to a
      particular lab on CAS (UWA's [Class Allocation System][cas]) in order to show up and
      ask questions.
    - You can drop in on [any timetabled lab][lab-room] – for a link to the timetable,
      see [below](#timetable) – from week 2 through to week 11.
    - No attendance is taken at timetabled lab sessions, and attendance is not compulsory.

    Model answers to exercises are normally provided the following week so you can gauge your progress.


    In later weeks, there may be topics where it's useful to have group discussions or get
    feedback from other students. Before we get to those labs, I'll assign groups and make
    the group details available on the CSSE department's [Moodle]({{moodle_url}}){{blank}}.
    Those groups can then arrange to meet online (e.g. via MS Teams) or in person at any
    time and place convenient to them – there is no need to physically meet on campus
    (unless you wish to).

    It's important to keep up with the lab material, so ensure you do some work on the lab materials every week (from week 2 onwards).

    {#
    Please make use of the lab facilitators! One of the best ways to
    gauge how well you understand a topic, or to find out if you are
    "on the right track" for a project, is to discuss them with the lab
    facilitators.
    #}

    **Laptop requirement**{ class="hi-pri" }: You will
    need to use **your own laptop**{ class="hi-pri" } when attending
    labs (as well as for the [final exam](/assessment/#exam)). The exact
    software you should install is discussed in more detail in the
    first lab (held in week *2*) – but in general, it is possible to
    access all the languages and frameworks we will look at using only a
    web browser.



[lab-room]: {{ '/faq/#attending-labs'  | url }}
[cas]: https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/752/~/class-allocation-system-%28cas%29-explained

**Moodle exercises** { #moodle-exercises }

:   Periodically, I'll post (unassessed) exercises on the school's
    {{ siteinfo.moodle }}{{blank}} server. You can complete these in your own time, and
    they will help you improve your understanding of testing and quality
assurance concepts.
    (All assessments will be completed using the Moodle server, too.) More
    information about these will be available in the first lab.

    You need to ensure you're [registered on Moodle](/faq/#moodle-registration) by the end
    of week 3, in order to complete the week 4 [assessment](/assessment/).

**List of timetabled sessions** { #timetable }

:   You can always get full details of lecture and lab times and venues by
    visiting UWA's **[Timetable site][timetable-site]{ target="_blank" }**{ class="hi-pri" }.
    (If the information for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }} is not visible, then enter "{{ siteinfo.unitcode }}" in the
    box labelled "Unit search", and then click "Show timetable".)

    {# x_ #}

    (Note, however, that in addition to all the labs that *are* running,
    the Timetable site may also show some lab sessions which are not yet
    running, due to insufficient demand -- check with the Unit Coordinator
    if you want to be sure whether a session is running.)

[timetable-site]: https://timetable.applications.uwa.edu.au/?selectunits={{ siteinfo.unitcode }}

### Lecture recordings

**The lectures are recorded**{ class="hi-pri" } --
see the list of [**Frequently Asked
Questions**](/faq#are-lecturers-recorded){ class="hi-pri" }.

But please note that recordings do
sometimes fail -- so if you *can* attend the lecture in-person
{# or online #}, it's recommended.

### Time required

Note that materials presented during class sessions
**<span>*do not*</span> define the whole unit**{ class="hi-pri" }.
A six-point unit is deemed to be equivalent to one quarter of a
full-time workload, so you would be expected to commit 10--12 hours
per week to the unit, averaged over the entire semester.
Outside of the contact hours (4 hours per week) for the unit, the
remainder of your time should be spent reading the recommended reading,
attempting exercises and working on assignment tasks.

### Preparing for lectures

The [**schedule**](/schedule){ class="hi-pri" }
contains the list of **recommended readings**{ class="hi-pri" } for each
topic. To gain maximum benefit from the lectures, I
recommend you review these *before* attending class.

### Who'll be helping in labs { #facilitators }

Our facilitators for labs are:

- James Arcus
- Abdullah Alelyani

{% set facilitators = ['james', 'abdullah'] %}

## Assumed knowledge { #assumed-knowledge }

Completion of 12 points of programming-based units is a prerequisite
for enrolling in {{ siteinfo.unitcode }}. In particular, it's assumed that you are
familiar with programming in at least one statically type-checked language
(typically either C or Java). Please let the Unit Coordinator
know as soon as possible if this is not the case.

We assume you are familiar with

- the difference between compile-time and run-time errors
- protections provided by a type system
- the difference between *interface* and *implementation* (abstraction,
  or information hiding)

Some revision information is available [here](/prior-study){ class="hi-pri" },
but we do not teach the topics "from scratch" -- it's your responsibility to
ensure you're familiar with them.

Advisable prior study for the unit is:
CITS3301/CITS4401 Software Requirements and Design.

We assume you are already familiar with

- what a software requirement is and how to express one
- the difference between functional and non-functional requirements
- what makes for good or bad software requirements

If not, you will need to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
We provide some brief revision materials [here](https://cits5501.arranstewart.io/prior-study),
but it's your responsibility to make sure you know and understand the material.

Some basic familiarity with testing frameworks for an OO language will be
helpful, but are not required:

- **For CITS1001/CITS2005**{ class="hi-pri" } (which uses the Java programming
  language), the relevant testing framework is [JUnit][junit]{ target="_blank" }.
  The textbook for CITS1001, [*Objects First with
  Java*][objects-first]{ target="_blank" } by Barnes and Kölling,
  contains good coverage of JUnit in Chapter 9, "Well-behaved
  objects".
- **For CITS1401**{ class="hi-pri" } (which uses the Python programming
  language), the relevant testing framework is
  [`unittest`][py-unittest]{ target="_blank" }.  The Python
  documentation contains basic examples of usage of the `unittest`
  library.

## Feedback survey

We want to ensure everyone enrolled in the unit is able to access
lectures, lab, and a suitable development environment in which to
complete exercises and assignments. We also want to find out what you're
finding useful (or not) about the unit.

So there is a survey for CITS2003/CITS4407 students available on the MS
Teams page for the unit -- you can also reach it by clicking
[**here**][survey-link]{ target="_blank" class="hi-pri" }. If you can
assist us by completing the survey before the end of **week 4**{:
class="hi-pri" :} (i.e., 5 pm Friday, 19 March) that would be greatly
appreciated.
